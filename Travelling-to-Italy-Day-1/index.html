Luckily I told S and R that we should really leave early because London could be really busy during bank holidays.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/q6ScnEB.jpg width=auto alt=londonbridge></div></p><p>We met at London Bridge station and took the train to Gatwick Airport together. Chatted the entire journey there, but I couldnâ€™t really remember what we said.</p><p>Gatwick was chaos, or, to be more specific, our airline was a mess. Because it was a last-minute kind of spontaneous trip, we didnâ€™t really have the time or budget to choose a good airline. After comparing the prices and our ideal travel time, we picked a flight from <a href=/Wizz-Air rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Wizz-Air>Wizz Air</a>. I have seen posters of them on the street a few times, and it seems like theyâ€™re the new Ryanair. Well, new doesnâ€™t mean better.</p><a href=#rant-about-wizz-air><h2 id=rant-about-wizz-air><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Rant about Wizz Air</h2></a><p>S&R selected the priority services for us, hoping we could speed up the process a bit during luggage check in and boarding.</p><p>It only came as a slap in the face because unlike the normal queue, there was only one person serving the priority line. The priority line was half as long as the normal one, but the normal line had 3-4 people attending, we ended up being the slower line. It took ages for us paid customers to be served by this one person who was scrutinizing everything, in the end we had to be squeezed in the normal queue so we could make it to boarding on time.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R5QHpuc.jpg width=auto alt=slowqueue></div></p><p>Security was fast, again it probably shows thereâ€™s nothing wrong with Gatwick itself, just Wizz Air thatâ€™s being unorganized. We ran to the gate, only to find out there was a huge queue for boarding, there wasnâ€™t a priority line this time, only one giant human sausage. Luckily everyone was kind of late they had to wait for us.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZNCb2eO.jpg width=auto alt=wonder></div></p><p><em>Saw this in the airport, I wonder what happened there.</em></p><p>I had a coffee on the plane, it was terrible as well. What can I say, theyâ€™re being super consistent with their products.</p><p>Avoid this airline please, if you can.</p><a href=#arriving-at-venice><h2 id=arriving-at-venice><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arriving at Venice</h2></a><p>We arrived at the airport in Venice after 2 hours, what struck me the most were two things:</p><ul><li><p>Air was moist</p></li><li><p>Every sign had Chinese translations</p></li></ul><p>Maybe there were many Chinese people visiting Venice? I had no idea.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GdrcgyA.jpg width=auto alt=signs></div></p><a href=#treviso><h2 id=treviso><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treviso</h2></a><p>I only knew a few things about our trip, I kinda wanted it to be a surprise as well by not knowing too much about the plan. R picked up a rental car which he would drive us all the way up north to the <a class="internal-link broken">Dolomites</a>, where we were going to stay for the next 2 nights.</p><p>We didnâ€™t have time to eat anything in the morning, so our first stop in Italy was a small city called <a class="internal-link broken">Treviso</a>, not far from Venice. The three of us found a cafÃ© called Gastronomia Albertini, next to where our car was parked.</p><p>So far, we hadnâ€™t had any situation where we needed to speak Italian, which none of us does anyway (R learned a few phrases on the plane). Treviso obviously being a non-tourist city, people donâ€™t speak English, we gestured and guessed our way through the ordering process. The lovely lady who seemed to be the owner of the place, was super patient with us, after like 20 minutes of guesswork and a bit of Google Translate, we finally finished ordering.</p><p>Over the years I had tried Raviolis a few times, I was never a fan, but I always thought for some reason this thing must be tasty, maybe itâ€™s just because I never had good ones before. And I was correct, in that little cafÃ©, I finally had the first Ravioli I really liked.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bAZEIXv.jpg width=auto alt=rav></div></p><p>Walking around the canal after the meal, a force drew us closer and closer to another place, where they sell gelatos. You cannot have a meal without following up with gelato, at least not in Italy.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xLLdrVa.jpg width=auto alt=gel></div></p><a href=#driving-north><h2 id=driving-north><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Driving North</h2></a><p>The carbs struck hard after the meal. I asked R if he could stop somewhere to get a coffee, he agreed a coffee might be a good idea since it would be a 3-hour drive in the sunset.</p><p>The cafÃ© we went to had an Asian woman serving behind the bar, and there was an old and slightly drunk man having a wine, flirting with her casually. I felt sorry we had to break them up.</p><p>While we were having the espresso there, I took a few moments to observe the situation. It seems like in a quiet countryside bar, the flirtation between a lonely barmaid and an old married man is more common than a fly swimming in a sweet summer drink.</p><p>Which reminded me of peaches. So I went next door, leaving my two friends at the scene, to buy some fruits for the evening.</p><p>The guy in the shop, who looked very comical because of his glasses and lovely smile, greeted me in Italian. We then got excited by the word London for a while, before I asked him about what local fruits he recommended, he called out a woman and asked me to repeat. I repeated but she couldnâ€™t understand.</p><p>All right, time for Google. After hearing the robotic Italian from my phone, her eyes immediately lit up, and helped me choose a wide range of produce. I bought a butt load of fruits and meat.</p><p><div class=img-container><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CZdjbY3.jpg width=auto alt=peach></div></p><a href=#haunted-house><h2 id=haunted-house><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Haunted House</h2></a><p>Towards the end of the journey we actually climbed in height, not very significant, and I slept through most of the journey. When I woke up, I realized we were resting just outside a petrol station. S felt hard to breathe, we waited until she felt more acclimated to the air pressure.</p><p>Since we were very late, we were only left with an instruction on how to get into the house, but the address was wrong.</p><p>After circling around a deserted house that looked like it came out of a horror film, we all agreed the house looked nothing like the picture.</p><p>There was literally no one around us, only the haunted house, dim light seeped through its broken windows and half sealed door. The air smelled of sheep manure. Oh no, weâ€™re stuck in a murder town.</p><p>Refuse to be buried there in animal shit, I checked the map again, turned out we are just a few streets away from the pinned location on Airbnb. Following the dot, we finally found our house.</p><p>It was less of a murder scene, but still it was too dark to see how it actually looked. The house was enormous, but we only booked two rooms, after a quick unpacking we found our own room and got ready to sleep.</p><p>My room was slightly underground, a bit damp, but manageable.</p><p>Sleeping without J was difficult, but after I turned off the lights, a cricket came in my room, and stayed with me the whole night.</p></article><hr><p style=text-align:center;font-weight:300;font-size:1rem;padding-bottom:1em>Join my newsletter to get hidden gems, content updates, and inside circle news.</p><div class=newsletter-signup><iframe src=https://niuthinking.substack.com/embed width=100% height=300 style=background:#fff frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe></div><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Wizz-Air/ data-ctx=Italy data-src=/Wizz-Air class=internal-link>Wizz Air</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
