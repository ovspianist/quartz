Having lived here in the UK for 9 years, I have decided to switch. \n\n\n\nThis action means I will have to give up my Chinese citizenship, one that is impossible to recover even if I wanted to. \n\n\n\nBecause of this, many Chinese people I know who hold an ILR here in the UK remain so, reluctant to give up the Chinese passport, keep paying and spending a lot of time in applying entry visas for almost all countries they want to visit. \n\n\n\nSuch is the burden of the first generation immigrants. Giving up the citizenship where your parents still live is a hard decision to make. \n\n\n\n## The One Direction\n\n\n\nDuring the past 3 years when China enforced a zero covid policy, entering the country became super hard, even if you have a Chinese passport. Strict quarantine rules, frequent flight cancellations and unofficial reasons for entry rejections, among other obstacles, made me rethink the validity of even holding onto Chinese passport. \n\n\n\nMany things over the past few years clearly demonstrated this particular country doesn‚Äôt love its people. In fact, people are nothing more than mere dispensable resources.\n\n\n\nI do not like America, but my impression is that if you hold an American passport, you have a strong backing. I certainly don‚Äôt think of my Chinese passport this way. A few months ago, during a demonstration outside Chinese embassy in the UK, some of the officers dragged the demonstrators into the embassy and violently beat them. The victims were Chinese as well. \n\n\n\nThe direction where China is headed remains a mystery to me, the decisions of a single mind by definition is always going to be harder to predict than those of a collective. \n\n\n\nBut since 2012, due to my particular interests and ways of working, I saw clearly how much of basic rights were taken away from us, year after year. On the surface, the economic growth was way too successful for most people to even notice the slippery slop on which freedom was taken away. \n\n\n\nI still remember the days, living in Shenzhen, we had the whole shebang of Internet. Google, Youtube, Facebook and of course, Vimeo. Among other websites and services that were crucial for our industry. It didn‚Äôt take long for us to lose all of those. At one point even Github was banned. What the actual fuck.\n\n\n\nSo even if I don‚Äôt know where exactly China is going, the direction never changed since 2012, and it worries me. \n\n\n\n## How about family?\n\n\n\nIndeed this is still my biggest concern, but I do know many people who switched and, as a result, have given up the Chinese citizenship. \n\n\n\nIt probably won‚Äôt be easy, but China is going either route on the border control front. \n\n\n\n### A. Remains tight control and discourages people from entering. \n\n\n\nI won‚Äôt be surprised if this is the case, wont make any sense but it could happens. In this case, even holding a Chinese passport doesn‚Äôt do you any better. \n\n\n\n### B. Opens up and encourages people to live and work in China. \n\n\n\nIn which case it wouldn‚Äôt matter which passport you hold, getting a visa should be quite straightforward like how it used to be. \n\n\n\nAll I‚Äôm saying is, if you legitimately need to swap for either personal or professional reasons, do not let this unpredictable government hinder your choices. \n\n\n\nInstead my focus is on becoming more and more free, financially, legally. So that if real tough choices are upon my shoulder, I will have earned myself more leeway in navigating such scenarios. \n\n\n\nFor casual visits, I don‚Äôt think it would matter that much. \n\n\n\n## If you are facing the dilemma and don‚Äôt know what to do\n\n\n\nAsk people who have made the switch and see how they deal with it. Or, you can reach out to me, I would be happy to discuss with you. \n\n\n\nI might be biased, but my bias on this matter never proved me wrong yet. So maybe they‚Äôre not biases. \n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-P1-Strategy":{"title":"Becoming the 3 P1 Strategy","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **The game of probability**\n\n\n\nDeep down at its core, trading is just like running a casino, it‚Äôs nothing but a game of probability. The difference is when you gamble, the casino has an absolute edge of winning over yours, while designed to be deceptively random.¬†\n\n\n\nYou might win once or twice, but over a large number of plays, the casino always wins. In order to win, you need to be the casino, not the gambler.\n\n\n\nProfitability = ( Wins% * Reward ) - ( Losses% * Risk )\n\n\n\nWhen you have a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, you really have to keep your winning probability above 33% to be profitable in the long run. Some people are more comfortable with higher risk-reward ratio such as 1:1, but with this ratio, you‚Äôll have to keep winning probability above 50% to make a profit.\n\n\n\nGenerally, the winning probability of a system is inverse proportional to the risk-reward ratio.¬†You cannot change the risk-reward ratio without affecting winning rate. So far, I haven‚Äôt seen any system or strategy that doesn‚Äôt follow this rule.\n\n\n\nHaving a strategy that has a genuine mathematical edge is crucial for trading success, luckily this is the easiest part to learn and develop within all the areas.\n\n\n\nThe outcome of any single trade is completely random, and it‚Äôs futile to try to predict it. What can be measured, predicted and acted on is the probability of one thing happening over the other in a series of trades.\n\n\n\n## **Back testing**\n\n\n\nIn case you don‚Äôt know already, back testing means testing your trading strategy with real historical price data to see how it performs. No matter what kind of strategy you decide to use, either you learned from others or developed on your own, bring it to test with real life historical data.¬†\n\n\n\nThere are some ways of running back tests automatically via commercial apps, with a scripting language of your choice, or completely manually. As long as you have accurate historical data, you could test out how your strategy performs over a series of 50 trades, at least.¬†\n\n\n\nProbability won‚Äôt work when you have a small set of samples.\n\n\n\nIf the result is not profitable over 50 trades, either make some changes to it, or just find another strategy, 50 trades are not a lot, but any solid strategy should at least give you a small profit at the end of that period.\n\n\n\n## **Risk of ruin**\n\n\n\nThere‚Äôs also an idea called \"Risk of Ruin\".\n\n\n\nAny chance of winning that‚Äôs less than exactly 100%, will give you losing trades, a probability of 50% of winning, statistically will have an 100% chance of generating 4 consecutive losing trades over 100 trades, and a 9% chance of generating 10 consecutive losing trades.\n\n\n\nLet this sink in, imagine yourself tossing a coin, and one after another you get a tail, for 10 times. How would you feel if every time it‚Äôs a tail you lose 3% of your whole account?\n\n\n\nYou need to accept it, because it will happen eventually.\n\n\n\nWith a 50% winning rate, you should expect to see a 10 trades long losing streak at some point, and it‚Äôs definitely not an indication that you‚Äôre trading badly.\n\n\n\nEncountering those losing streaks in the back testing stage before you start trading live, will help you learn how to deal with the negative feeling. Especially if the losing streak happens right at the beginning of live trading, it could be extremely hard to maintain your composure and keep trading the strategy exactly it should be traded, since you have no idea if there‚Äôs something wrong with the strategy or just the statistical inevitability.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs very important to keep this in mind, if you risk 5% of your remaining equity every time, in the event of this unfortunate 10 trades losing streak, you‚Äôll have a 40% drawdown( 0.95 to the power of 10 ), if you risk 10%, that‚Äôll be a 66% drawdown.\n\n\n\nAfter you have a 50% drawdown, you will need to make a 100% profit to break even.\n\n\n\nThe lower your winning rate is, the less you need to risk per trade so that these unforeseeable losing streaks don‚Äôt destroy your account.\n\n\n\n## **Try to break your strategy**\n\n\n\nIf your results in back testing proves that strategy could be profitable, try to break it by changing some parameters that define your strategy, in an ideal situation, the changes you make are going to affect the performance gradually, let‚Äôs say if you now tweak the distance between your entry point and stop loss point, together with the distance to take profit point so that they maintain the same ratio.¬†\n\n\n\nJust by scaling up and down the distances, you‚Äôll have different performance, you might find out with the distances shorter, it‚Äôs more likely to hit your stop loss and then reverse, or it might be too wide that a large number of trades couldn‚Äôt reach your take profit point before reversing. Your job is to find the optimal distances that maximise winning rate.\n\n\n\nIf you change the parameter gradually, but the results end up jumping up and down as if there‚Äôs no connection to the parameter you tweaked, then there might be a systematic flaw with your strategy. Ideally performance changes gradually and there is often an area that gives you the best performance.\n\n\n\n## **Paper trading**\n\n\n\nAfter thorough back testing and fine tuning the strategy, now you‚Äôre ready to trade, but I strongly advise you to do a forward testing.\n\n\n\nWhat is forward testing now?\n\n\n\nSimilar to back testing, but instead of using historical data, you‚Äôll be using live data, testing your strategy as it happens. This is pretty much like live trading, but in a safe environment.\n\n\n\nIf you have access to a trading platform that provides paper trading accounts or trading simulators, it‚Äôll be the best tool to forward test. They allow you to trade like a live account, but with fake money, and it‚Äôs great for testing your strategy.\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a platform to paper trade, there‚Äôs always the option to just do it on a charting software, TradingView for instance, allows you to place simulated trades on the chart.¬†\n\n\n\n**_Forward testing provides a few benefits over back testing, such as:_**\n\n\n\n-   Back testing can‚Äôt simulate waiting time. In forward testing, you have to wait for the trades to resolve in their own time, you might have some doubts before a trade ends, and some people don‚Äôt have the patience to let it play out.¬†\n\n\n\n-   Depending what instruments are designed to be used with the strategy, if you only have 1 concurrent trade allowed at any given moment, and you happen to see 2 or more trading opportunities, you can only choose one, this might affect the real performance. It‚Äôs hard to spot this when back testing.\n\n\n\n-   For part time traders, missing opportunities is normal, when you‚Äôre back testing you won‚Äôt find out that all those trades that happen around dinner time are actually not possible to execute, in forward testing you can.\n\n\n\n**_However even forward testing cannot give you the full experience as you would have in live trading:_**\n\n\n\n-   Simulators can‚Äôt simulate emotions which you will have when trading live, losing fake money probably feels like nothing other than a dent in your confidence, while losing real money might shake your whole belief in trading in general.\n\n\n\n-   For some fast trading styles such as scalping, slippage is frequent in live trading but simulators don‚Äôt include the impact of slippage.\n\n\n\n-   Size does matter in paper trading, one common mistake new traders make is to trade way bigger sizes and more aggressive than what they can afford in future live trading, not treating paper trading exactly like live trading is likely to encourage bad habits.\n\n\n\n## **Focus on one strategy**\n\n\n\nAt least at the beginning, juggling between several different strategies will only diverge your attention.¬†\n\n\n\nLearning is a process of turning knowledge from consciousness into subconscious so you can utilise it naturally without thinking hard.\n\n\n\nI see trading as sports, there‚Äôs training and there‚Äôs competition. When you‚Äôre in the actual game competing with others, you‚Äôd better be sure you have all the techniques fully developed before jumping in.¬†\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs the worst time where you should be thinking about how to do certain things.\n\n\n\nThere are traders who constantly switch between different markets and trading styles, I would advise against trading like that when you‚Äôre starting out. If you want to add another strategy or trading style, do it after you‚Äôve proven consistently profitable with one strategy.\n\n\n\n## **Pick strategies that fit your personality**\n\n\n\nThis is more about optimisation than validity, there are many strategies with proven profitability, but you might find most of them hard to adopt because how they are executed.\n\n\n\nSay you have a 9-5 job and only trade part time, a strategy that requires a lot of screen time during daytime is probably not for you.\n\n\n\nMaybe you are not comfortable to trade in a very fast fashion, then active day trading might not be a good fit.\n\n\n\nOr like myself, you seek quick action and more aggressive approach, swing trading is simply too slow to consider.\n\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n\n\nThe topics I listed above are just some of the important aspects in developing and adapting strategies that apply to most active traders, based on your own trading style you might have more or different components to check against.¬†\n\n\n\nMake sure you understand all of these key points and find out which strategy you‚Äôll be focusing on, is the first step forward.¬†\n\n\n\nHow far are you now after you have figured all those things out?¬†\n\n\n\nIf you agree with the consensus about how much importance strategies hold, then you are 10% there.\n\n\n\n\u003e Trading is 10% strategy, 30% risk management and 60% psychology.\n\n\n**I agree.**\n\n\n\nEspecially after blowing up my account twice.\n\n\n\nIn the next article let‚Äôs have a look at risk management, the art of keeping the money you made and not giving back everything when things go bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA series of articles on how to become the 3% of people who actually make consistent profit in the financial market.\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% - Unpacking the One Metric](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20Unpacking%20the%20One%20Metric.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% ‚Äì Part 1 ‚Äì Strategy](Becoming%20the%203%20P1%20Strategy.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% ‚Äì Part 2 ‚Äì Risk Management](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20P2%20Risk%20Management.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% - Part 3 - Psychology](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20P3%20Psychology.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-P2-Risk-Management":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct P2 Risk Management","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% ‚Äì Part 2 ‚Äì Risk Management\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople always say survive before you thrive, for traders that‚Äôs particularly true.\n\n\n\nA common thread that runs through most of those successful traders is that, before they started producing consistent profit, they have all blown their accounts once or more times.\n\n\n\nIs it really inevitable on the journey to trading success? What exactly did they learn in the process?\n\n\n\nThey learned to respect risk management rules.\n\n\n\nHaving a strategy that promises profit is what draws people towards the market, but in the long run what keeps them in the market is risk management.\n\n\n\nManaging risks is the most widely agreed tenet across all types of trading communities. Without a proper risk management system, there is no way of protecting your profit from potential losses.\n\n\n\nNo matter how good your trading strategy is, if you don‚Äôt take risks seriously, one loss might have the potential to wipe you out. Without proper risk management, blowing up your account is inevitable, it‚Äôs just a matter of time when that happens. They don‚Äôt happen often, but when they do, they are normally catastrophic.\n\n\n\nHowever, tightening up losses is unarguably super hard to do.\n\n\n\n## **Are you calculating size correctly before entering a trade?**\n\n\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter how you want to approach position sizing, either by a percentage of your equity, or by a predetermined number of shares, as long as you have a system for it, respect it and follow it rigorously.\n\n\n\nNo trade at any given moment should hold the power to completely eliminate your account, meaning you should always calculate your trading size so that even when the worst case scenario happens, you are still left with most of the account.\n\n\n\n## **Are you cutting your losses when the trades go against you?**\n\n\n\nIf you have trouble cutting the loss, are you using an automatic stop loss order?\n\n\n\nLetting losers run and cutting winners early is one of the main reasons people are not profitable.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most common mistake people make, and it‚Äôs the easiest to fix on paper, most traders‚Äô poor performance could be drastically improve just by cutting losses earlier, it could turn a losing trader into a winning one just by doing that alone.\n\n\n\nPersonally I am guilty of this too. If you stand next to me and force me to cut my bad losing trades, it will almost completely eliminate my losing days.\n\n\n\nI won‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs easy to learn this, the reason behind this is that we don‚Äôt want to admit being wrong. Unrealised loss has the potential to turn around and becomes profit, cutting the loss destroys any possibility of turning it around, and we will be forced to accept defeat, at least this one trade.\n\n\n\nBut in my experience, cutting the loss earlier is never worse than holding, yes sometimes it does turn around and you might exit break even or even make a profit, majority of the time they just keep going and going, until the pain is too intense to keep holding and we‚Äôre forced to exit at our max loss threshold.\n\n\n\nAfter that, there‚Äôs always the same regret, why didn‚Äôt I cut the trade earlier?\n\n\n\nCut your losing trades earlier.\n\n\n\n## **Are you giving the trades time to develop according to your trading plan?**\n\n\n\nIt may feel like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking profit before it hits your profit target, in some cases yes, but you have to understand if you‚Äôre constantly taking profit too soon, you might miss a lot of profit potential.\n\n\n\nIn a well back tested system where a pre-defined set of rules are set and balanced to generate a stable profitability over a large number of samples, taking profit too early might skew the overall P/L towards negative. Since you‚Äôre always letting losses reach the max, but cutting profit short, in the long run, you‚Äôll damage profitability.\n\n\n\n## **Are your positions correlated?**\n\n\n\nSome of your concurrent positions might be deep down correlated, if that‚Äôs the case, when one experiences a drawdown, the others will do the same. This could be a big issue, let‚Äôs say you are risking 3% of your equity per trade, and you have 5 open positions.\n\n\n\nIf they‚Äôre correlated and turn out to be losers, you‚Äôre losing 15% of your equity. It‚Äôll behave more like a 15% risk trade instead of 5 trades that are risking 3%.\n\n\n\nA small losing streak might take you out.\n\n\n\nFind out how much they‚Äôre correlated before you get in trades that happen at the same time.\n\n\n\nStocks that belong to the same sector, forex pairs that are using the same base currencies, or ETFS that are tracking the same industries.\n\n\n\nEither diversify the instruments or lower the risks per trade.\n\n\n\n## **Are you taking events into consideration?**\n\n\n\nEvents such as earnings or governmental financial reports could have big impacts on how prices move.\n\n\n\nThese events create a lot of volatility but they are unpredictable. Especially those trades that are using automatic stop loss orders, when these kind of events happen price can make huge sudden moves and that might trigger your stoploss and then reverse and go the other way.\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre not sure how much of an impact any certain event has on your trades, it‚Äôs better to just not trade.\n\n\n\n## **Are you only taking the best quality trades?**\n\n\n\nWhen the overall market is experiencing a drawdown such as right now in February 2022, there could be a severe decrease in trading opportunities for some strategies.\n\n\n\nOut of boredom, some traders start to trade B or C quality trading setups that are most likely to hurt performance on average.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs funny to think trading is different to other businesses in a way that when we are trading we control how to sell and buy independently.\n\n\n\nJust like selling umbrellas and ice creams, naturally the sale of such items is heavily affected by the weather on a large scale. It‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt sell ice cream in winter, just the profit potential is much less than selling hot tea.\n\n\n\nIn a declining market condition, long biases traders are collectively resistant in buying and taking risks when price is struggling to break certain threshold, resulting in bears winning most battles.\n\n\n\nRecognising what kind of market you‚Äôre in helps you fine tune your strategy to maximise profit potential and avoid big losses.\n\n\n\nForcing a trade in a subpar market condition is in fact taking more risk for less gain.\n\n\n\n## **But why is it so hard to do?**\n\n\n\nSuccessful risk management sounds easy on paper, but most traders fail at following it. The reason isn‚Äôt that the risk management rules are not clear or technically hard to execute.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs ourselves that we cannot control.\n\n\n\nBeing in a trade is exactly like being in a romantic relationship, giving other people advice is a piece of cake, but when it comes to your own trading(or relationship), you are suddenly blind to all the flaws and mistakes you would‚Äôve clearly see if it were happening to others.\n\n\n\nIn the next article we will have a look at the common areas that trip people over all the time in their own head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-P3-Psychology":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct P3 Psychology","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% - Part 3 - Psychology \n\n\n\nSome people are born with the right aptitudes for becoming a good trader, these lucky people are:\n\n\n\n-   **disciplined**, once a clear rule is set, they respect and follow it rigorously without exception.\n\n-   **brave**, enough to not be affected by doubt and second guessing.\n\n-   **decisive**, able to pull the trigger when it‚Äôs needed, fast without hesitation.\n\n-   **calm**, because they know how a trading strategy works and won‚Äôt be agitated by the small ups and downs, and they‚Äôre able to maintain composure in a losing streak.\n\n-   **objective**, they can think in probability and large numbers, distinguish facts and opinions.\n\n-   **resilient**, it‚Äôs not uncommon for a trader to get knocked down by the market many times, they are able to reset, readjust and retry no matter what.\n\n-   **honest**, most profitable traders only have 65% accuracy, they are wrong 35% of time on average, you have to honestly admit you‚Äôre wrong and be okay with it, being profitable has nothing to do with being right all the time.\n\n\n\nThese attributes don‚Äôt come naturally to most people, but they are exactly what we need to aim for when training to be a trader.\n\n\n\nI would consider obtaining a good level of these qualities to be a substantial step towards being a professional trader.\n\n\n\n## **Keeping a trading journal**\n\n\n\nA while ago I started taking notes for all the trades I made, since then, my trading performance saw some drastic improvement. It seems like the action of writing down your thoughts about the trades every day, really burns the idea in your head.\n\n\n\nWhen I am in the middle of active trading I sometimes get very emotional, writing it down either right after I have the feeling or after I finish trading, helps me recognise and address those problems.\n\n\n\nI still make mistakes I would like to stop making, but keeping a journal at least helps me visualise my progress and forces me to be honest with myself, it could be enhanced by sharing them to other traders too.\n\n\n\nJust in case you‚Äôre curious, I use Tradervue to record all my trades and every day I write down a detailed journal of what I trade, how I trade. You don‚Äôt really need a dedicated journal software to do this, any notebook app or even pen and paper would do.\n\n\n\n**There are 4 things I keep track of mainly:**\n\n\n\n-   **market condition**, I write this before I take any trade if possible.\n\n-   **mental state**, am I too eager? Distracted? Fearful? Agitated? Calm?\n\n-   **performance**, here is detailed walk through of the whole trading day.\n\n-   **to improve**, after finishing the trading day, I write down all the things I could‚Äôve done better today and remind myself next day.\n\n\n\nHowever you might decide to track and reflect different areas based on your trading style, instrument and time frame.\n\n\n\nOne trader I look up to a lot once said, almost all of the best traders keep detailed record of their trades, some also plan ahead before they trade on paper. If you ask them about their accuracy, profit loss ratio, risk parameters, they will know all the metrics by heart.\n\n\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúI find it hard to take a developing trader seriously who isn‚Äôt keeping a detailed daily trading journal.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e Mike Bellafiore, SMB Capital\n\n\nTo solve a problem you must first acknowledge the problem, I recommend that you start your trading journals if you haven‚Äôt already, better late than never.\n\n\n\n## **Avoiding FOMO**\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone is having constant battle with it, the fear of missing out.\n\n\n\nThe problem that comes with FOMO is destructive, when a price move went without you and you start to chase, you‚Äôll most likely to enter a trade, either long or short, on the extension, a place where it‚Äôs most likely to follow up with a pullback. If this move is then proven lack of conviction, it might not even be a pullback anymore. Worst case scenario that‚Äôs the furthest spot it could go, before shooting in the opposite direction with high momentum.\n\n\n\nEven if it is a pullback, you might decide to wait for it to come back to your entry price. It could happen, but it could just as well keep going in the other direction.\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll be trapped in the trade and forced to liquidate the position with a big loss.\n\n\n\nThe moment we feel FOMO kicking in, more often than not, is precisely the end of the momentum. The more impressive the move is, the more your FOMO would be, the more likely a reversal is due.\n\n\n\n## **Be selective**\n\n\n\nA good trader learns and accepts the fact that there are cycles in the market, the bull, the bear and the consolidation, not every type of market is suitable to trade with your strategy.\n\n\n\nNot trading in a market that‚Äôs less favourable for your strategy could be very hard, but most traders will agree that sitting through those period in cash, is often the best move.\n\n\n\nBeing selective also means choosing between a bunch of different stocks or currencies, sometimes we are so fixated on the technical patterns we detected on the chart, that we become blind to other factors that define a good trade, be it wrong time of day, lack of volume or historical false attempts.\n\n\n\nFailing to perform a full check on the stock and trade idea is at best a waste of time, if you get good result out of a bad trade, you‚Äôll be encouraged to break the rules again, sooner or later your accuracy will suffer and likely generate big losses. Worst of all, you might lose confidence and when there are finally good opportunities you have become too afraid to act on them.\n\n\n\nTrade the best and leave the rest.\n\n\n\n## **Revenge trading**\n\n\n\nA few scenarios will trigger a trader to act recklessly:\n\n\n\n-   missing a trade that moves in your favour but you‚Äôre too late to get in.\n\n-   price hits your stop loss and then immediately reverses to your intended direction and hits your original profit target price.\n\n-   losing more than half of your profit.\n\n-   starting with profit then becomes losses.\n\n-   one trade that wipes your profits from many trades.\n\n\n\nPersonally if I start the day with profit and then turn negative, I would be very annoyed and likely to start revenge trading, the trajectory after that is normally a nosedive into the red abyss, digging a hole that will take me days to recover, if I‚Äôm lucky.\n\n\n\nLearning to recognise those triggers and being able to act early to stop yourself descending deeper and deeper into the bad situation would drastically trim down your biggest red days(weeks or months depending on your trading frequency), which also means an easier time to recover.\n\n\n\n## **Dollar amount vs percentage**\n\n\n\nWhenever I can, I try to focus on my performance in percentage instead of in dollar amount.\n\n\n\nA loss can look big but when put into perspective in relation to the account size, it might just be 3% of your equity. To me, losing 3% feels much better than losing 3000 dollars, when you have a 100,000 account.\n\n\n\nMost people, even us traders, will equate dollars to stuff they can and want to buy, so 3000 dollars could be the beautiful camera or the trip to Iceland you have always wanted, and you just threw it away.\n\n\n\nHowever a 3% drawdown is considered very acceptable to most traders.\n\n\n\nWhile your account is constantly growing, the dollar amount is also changing, seeing the progress in percentage helps you normalise performance, if you can score a 3% profit every day, after 6 months of trading it‚Äôll be 34 times of your starting point.\n\n\n\nTechnically a 3K dollars profit with a 100K account and a 30 dollars profit with a 1000 account, is exactly the same in terms of performance, the implication is that if you can do well with 3% with a small account, while 30 dollars may look insignificant, you prove you are equipped with the good knowledge and techniques to do well with a larger account.\n\n\n\nKeeping track of this percentage you‚Äôll also have a clear idea when and where you‚Äôre deviating from the baseline performance, are you getting sloppy and over confident, or not being able to strictly following your own rules? They are all going to reflect on the history of percentage.\n\n\n\n## **Quality of trades**\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs another problem, even percentage could be misleading sometimes, especially in a choppy market, you need to be extra careful of what to trade and what to leave alone. The market doesn‚Äôt care about your P/L or trading setups, so even percentage of gain is really out of your control, what you can control though, is the quality of the trade.\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre using a discretionary strategy in which you organically come up with stop loss and take profit levels as the trade unfolds, you should base your reaction on the technicals of the trade itself, not how much money you want to take out of the market.\n\n\n\nIf price is clearly heading towards a strong resistance level, it would be wrong to hope it‚Äôll break through. You should either not enter the trade, or enter the trade but exit before reaching the danger zone.\n\n\n\nAgain, the market doesn‚Äôt know or care if you hit your 3% daily goal or not, it does what it wants.\n\n\n\n## **Commissions**\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre an active day trader using a small account, some brokers charge you commissions that‚Äôs just not proportional to the account size. If you can only make 10 dollars with appropriate position size, and the commissions for a buy and a sell cost you 5 dollars, you are not going to make money. You‚Äôll only have half of profit left, at the same time all your losses are much bigger after commissions.\n\n\n\nUnless you have amazing accuracy and risk control, even profits sometimes end up losses because the high commissions weigh down the whole level. As a beginner trader, having a consistent break-even performance is already a challenge.\n\n\n\nSo how do you deal with this mentally?\n\n\n\nI have been struggling with this as well. The best thing to do is to ignore the commissions, don‚Äôt even think about the net P/L after commissions. What you should be focusing on is practising discipline and consistency, not the amount of money you make. The amount of drawdown incurred by the commissions will automatically ease off when you start trading larger sizes.\n\n\n\nWhat you definitely don‚Äôt want to do, is to change the way you trade to combat the impact. You need to practise the strategy as if you are trading normal size, distorting the rules to accommodate a small account will give you distorted results. Having a habit built on distorted rules is very dangerous when you switch to a big account.\n\n\n\nAlthough, there is one valid optimisation you can adopt, which is to limit the quantity of trades so you don‚Äôt waste commissions. Not only that, it also has the benefit of forcing you to only trade the best setups and be extremely selective, since you don‚Äôt want to waste your only trade on opportunities less than ideal.\n\n\n\n## **Transition to live account from paper account**\n\n\n\nMark Douglas said something that made me look at paper trading from a completely different angle, I‚Äôll paraphrase what he said because I can‚Äôt find the original quote.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúPaper trading result is the performance you could have if you operate without fear, greed and other psychological blocks.‚Äù\n\n\n\nI sometimes wish someone secretly swaps my paper account with live account, I think I would‚Äôve have much better result by thinking I am trading a simulator than live.\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone experience this dip in performance when switching to live account from paper, suddenly all those numbers in unrealised P/L start to have huge impact in psychology, decision making can be seriously damaged if greed and fear come in.\n\n\n\nOne popular advice is to start small, granted that trading is a risky business and losing is inevitable, but a small account will reduce the likelihood of losing emotional control.\n\n\n\nMake sure all the potential losses are not something you can‚Äôt make back in one or two days, if you put one month‚Äôs salary worth of money to the account, losing 3-5% per day will probably be all right since it‚Äôs money you can make back in a few days. At least to me personally, that‚Äôs the level I am comfortable with emotionally.\n\n\n\nIf you are day trading like me, with a broker that charges commissions on each trade, then the account can‚Äôt be too small either, as I said before, the sizes should be high enough so that commissions won‚Äôt completely eliminate potential profits.\n\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôre trading live, don‚Äôt go back to simulation if you can still afford it. Going back and forth between live and simulation is generally not a good idea since you might perform better again in the simulator and then come back to live, experience the fear and lose again. Quite a lot of people get stuck in this vicious circle.\n\n\n\nSimulation should be stopped once you have mastered the technical side of trading such as putting orders, exiting positions, managing stop loss and take profit, etc. After you are able to identify and execute trading setups, you shouldn‚Äôt really go back to simulation as long as you can afford staying in live account.\n\n\n\nIf your psychology is the reason why you have bad trading results, then going back to simulation isn‚Äôt going to provide any real solutions, since simulation can‚Äôt really simulate emotions you‚Äôd have in live trading, the best it can provide is reaffirming your strategy works, which is already proven in the strategy development and validation period anyway.\n\n\n\nThe only way forward is to face your fear and greed directly, accept loss and defeat objectively, work on it patiently, day after day, little by little, focus on gradual improvements which eventually turn to consistent profitability.\n\n\n\nI have just lost 20% of my account yesterday, it was painful, and it wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault but mine. Monetary loss is not fun, but what I care about most is how much I follow and respect my own rules, because that is the only thing I can control.\n\n\n\n## **Putting it together**\n\n\n\nA common false belief, although I wish it to be true, is that there‚Äôs an Ah Ha moment, an epiphany, or a click, that sends a struggling trader directly to the heaven of profitability. Unfortunately from what I gathered, that is not the case.\n\n\n\nThere has almost never been one moment that has the power to completely enables a trader to become a millionaire, unless you YOLO into a wall street bet and lucky enough to win, but that‚Äôs gambling, we are trying to be traders, not gamblers.\n\n\n\nTraders need to go through a lot of trials and errors, to finally turn those habitual self destructive behaviour to consistently profitable trading.\n\n\n\nPerformance of a great dancer might make you feel like dancing is easy, the fluid and effortless movement is a facade, what really happens underneath is hundreds of muscles working hard to maintain the look of elegance on the surface.\n\n\n\nSome of the elements could become second nature after years of practice, but to perform consistently well every time still requires undivided attention, focus and vigilance.\n\n\n\n## **Visualisation**\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre a visual person like me, it‚Äôs not a crazy idea to list all the areas and sub areas you want to improve upon, in terms of process, not results.\n\n\n\nSay you want to limit the times you FOMO into a trade, put a FOMO column on a spreadsheet and each day you start a new row and colour the corresponding slot based on how well you did that day.\n\n\n\nOr you want to track how well you cut losing trades timely and ruthlessly, put a column for it and keep evaluating this metric every day.\n\n\n\nOver time you will see a cloud of data points that demonstrate your dedication, determination and perseverance, shifting in colour from the behaviours you want to avoid, to those that represent a professional trader.\n\n\n\nProfitability is only possible after you become fully responsible for your own actions and not blame the market for anything. The market is too big for you to control, what you can control though, is how well you respect these rules.\n\n\n\n\u003e Focus on process and results will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-Unpacking-the-One-Metric":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct Unpacking the One Metric","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% - Unpacking the One Metric\n\n\n\n\n\n## **The One Metric - P/L**\n\n\n\nWhen you‚Äôre still learning to trade and yet to be profitable, finding out a way to check if you‚Äôre on the right track is super important to your future trading success.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, all trading performances could be judged by one metric, and that is whether you‚Äôre profitable during a period of time or not. A positive P/L means you‚Äôre good at trading, a negative one means you‚Äôre a bad trader.\n\n\n\nIt might look binary if you just focus on the P/L, but the reality is, to be a consistently profitable trader, one has to do a lot of things right to have an edge in the market. This is one of those cases that can be explained with the classic wooden barrel theory, if you have even one shortcoming, it might be the one that destroys you and prevents you from being successful at trading.\n\n\n\n## **Rocket Building**\n\n\n\nHave you ever watched a rocket launch event? There are only two major outcomes, successful or failed. But when the launch process itself fails, no one would ever doubt the work being put behind the scenes. Even if you don‚Äôt know anything about building a rocket, it won‚Äôt be hard to understand that, the process of a rocket launch is merely executing a plan that‚Äôs been carefully designed beforehand.\n\n\n\nTrading should follow the same logic, when you‚Äôre executing a trade, it would be simply following a trading plan that‚Äôs been prepared in advance. Your ability to form such plans would be equivalent to the work that goes into building the rocket itself and launch procedures, without the essential work on the individual components that make up the rocket or the trader, the final product won‚Äôt be able to withstand the ever changing market.\n\n\n\n## **Areas of focus**\n\n\n\nSo how do we evaluate progress before you are consistently profitable?\n\n\n\nInstead of looking at the final P/L of every day, every week, every month, we should focus on different components required to trade properly.\n\n\n\nWhen we start to break down the areas where an aspiring trader needs to improve, suddenly that one binary metric expands to an array of quantitative(relatively) attributes and goals to measure against.\n\n\n\nIt is a well-known fact that there are 3 cornerstones in any profitable trading:\n\n\n\n-   Strategy\n\n-   Risk management\n\n-   Psychology\n\n\n\nEach category contains many aspects a trader needs to work on before they can achieve long term success.\n\n\n\nI will break down each one of them in the future posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Blueprints-System":{"title":"Blueprints System","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## UI\n\n\n\nI really don't like Unreal Engine's UI design, everything looks very chunky and full of visual distractions.

To keep a digital garden, the end goal isn't to have perfectly written articles, instead the process of slowly growing the interconnected knowledge is what digital gardening really cares about.\n\n\n\nOur brains are very good at generating ideas, but sucks at holding the information for a longer period of time. Even a brilliant idea in the shower would quickly vanish the moment you step out of the bathroom. The reason has something to do with how our memories are stored.\n\n\n\nA system that enable us to capture our fleeting thoughts is not only beneficial for de-cluttering our mind, but also crucial for us to navigate the world in a constant information overload. \n\n\n\n## Public Writing\n\n\n\nWriting and presenting stuff online could be terrifying, the idea of a published piece carries a lot of responsibilities. However, using a system like digital gardens changes people's expectation towards the articles, it's also good to prevent becoming a perfectionist: you know you can always change the text, in fact, one of the core ideas of digital gardening is that you need to keep updating and polishing as you go along. \n\n\n\nThe most important thing about writing is the act of writing, I remember Hemingway once said, write drunk, edit sober. Writing is kind of hard, but if you accept the fact that first drafts are going to be bad, and you can always make changes later down the line, it frees up the writer.\n\n\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\n\n## A Second Brain\n\n\n\n[Building A Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book) by Tiago Forte is in some way related to the topic of digital gardening in a sense that both methods are encouraging the accumulation and constant reshaping of [[Atomic Notes]]. The method focuses on the process of making ideas stand on their own, as well as making connections between them. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Related\n\n\n\n[[Zettelkasten]]\n\n\n\n## Reference\n\n\n\n[A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.907480561Z","tags":null},"/Evergreen-Notes":{"title":"Evergreen Notes","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvergreen notes are notes you keep building over time, instead of a fixed definition of an idea, these notes slowly grow, evolve and accumulate over time.

How freely can the reader interpret it? Could a nursery rhyme like Baa Baa Black Sheep be full of concealed loathing, resentment and aggression? In this accessible, delightfully entertaining book, Terry Eagleton addresses these intriguing questions and a host of others. How to Read Literature is the book of choice for students new to the study of literature and for all other readers interested in deepening their understanding and enriching their reading experience. In a series of brilliant analyses, Eagleton shows how to read with due attention to tone, rhythm, texture, syntax, allusion, ambiguity, and other formal aspects of literary works. He also examines broader questions of character, plot, narrative, the creative imagination, the meaning of fictionality, and the tension between what works of literature say and what they show. Unfailingly authoritative and cheerfully opinionated, the author provides useful commentaries on classicism, Romanticism, modernism and postmodernism along with spellbinding insights into a huge range of authors, from Shakespeare and Jane Austen to Samuel Beckett and J.

Their music speaks to the deepest part of the listeners, in a language that can't be translated, but only be felt.\n\n\n\nSome people might say his music is a bit too simple, true while it may be, but judging art by simplicity is subjective to philosophical debates to begin with. To the listeners, whether the artist chose to adopt a device of simple harmony or complex arrangements of multiple sonic parts is completely personal and contextual. The power of which also isn't determined by how complicated it is. \n\n\n\nCertain simple expressions also cut deepest.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Some Kind of Peace\n\n\n\nWith that being said, this concert was loosely based on his recent album ‚Äúsome kind of peace‚Äù which I am not a big fan of.\n\n\n\nBut after so many times of postponing the show due to the pandemic, he finally started going on tours again, my friend Spike and I took the chance and booked the tickets. The tour only stops in London for two days, we went on the first day.\n\n\n\nThe concert started with ‚ÄúLoom‚Äù, which happened to be my favourite song from this album.\n\n\n\nLoom is where he collaborated with [[@Bonobo]], another electronic artist I quite like. Here the piano notes act as decorations, sprinkled on top of the bass section, with a faint and distant minimalistic vocal part swimming in between, threading through all this. \n\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/Kvsa1cE.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Glitches\n\n\n\nHalfway into the show, signal glitches started trickling in, they weren't too imposing but enough to be noticed, especially considering all the songs were quiet and slow paced. \n\n\n\nIt went on for about 10 to 20 minutes, on and off, I thought Olafur would stop the show to fix the issue, but he just went on, ignoring the glitches which eventually faded away on its own.\n\n\n\nThe family sitting in front of us, all the children behave like responsible adults, however the mother just couldn't help herself typing away on her phone, the dad tried to stop her many times, but she insisted there are things more important on the phone and needed to be dealt with immediately. \n\n\n\nAnother woman sitting next to them, completely unrelated to them, for every few minutes she tried to take a photo of the show, and for some reason she cannot turn off the bloody flashlight and every time she was surprised by the sudden beam of light shooting out of her phone. No matter how many times she annoyed people around her, she kept trying.\n\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/B1UGRMf.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Quiet Olafur\n\n\n\nOlafur didn't talk a lot, I remember watching his show online where he became very chatty between songs, not on this show, well at least not until after he appeared for encore.\n\n\n\nHe then told a story about the last song he was going to play. I'll try to paraphrase the story, as it was a particularly heart-warming one.\n\n\n\nOlafur's grandma would often ask him to go visit her because her radio was broken, but he knew, every time, the radio wasn't broken at all. But he went there, unexpectedly, to find out his grandma had prepared cookies and cakes for him, and would ask him to listen to Chopin with her, and that's what he did every time. \n\n\n\nBefore becoming the Olafur we know today, he was a drummer in a band called \"Fighting Shit‚Äù, of course his grandma wasn't a fan. After he quit the old funk band and started writing neoclassical music, he said, his grandma became the biggest fan. She would buy his albums in bulk and would just go out to meet her friends and sell them. Aren't all grandmas like her?\n\n\n\nFor her last moments, Olafur sat next to her bed in the hospital and listened to Chopin, before she eventually passed away.

Luckily I told S and R that we should really leave early because London could be really busy during bank holidays.\n\n\n\n![londonbridge](https://i.imgur.com/q6ScnEB.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe met at London Bridge station and took the train to Gatwick Airport together. Chatted the entire journey there, but I couldn‚Äôt really remember what we said.\n\n\n\nGatwick was chaos, or, to be more specific, our airline was a mess. Because it was a last-minute kind of spontaneous trip, we didn‚Äôt really have the time or budget to choose a good airline. After comparing the prices and our ideal travel time, we picked a flight from [[Wizz Air]]. I have seen posters of them on the street a few times, and it seems like they‚Äôre the new Ryanair. Well, new doesn‚Äôt mean better.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Rant about Wizz Air\n\n\n\nS\u0026R selected the priority services for us, hoping we could speed up the process a bit during luggage check in and boarding. \n\n\n\nIt only came as a slap in the face because unlike the normal queue, there was only one person serving the priority line. The priority line was half as long as the normal one, but the normal line had 3-4 people attending, we ended up being the slower line. It took ages for us paid customers to be served by this one person who was scrutinizing everything, in the end we had to be squeezed in the normal queue so we could make it to boarding on time.\n\n\n\n![slowqueue](https://i.imgur.com/R5QHpuc.jpg)\n\n\n\nSecurity was fast, again it probably shows there‚Äôs nothing wrong with Gatwick itself, just Wizz Air that‚Äôs being unorganized. We ran to the gate, only to find out there was a huge queue for boarding, there wasn‚Äôt a priority line this time, only one giant human sausage. Luckily everyone was kind of late they had to wait for us.\n\n\n\n![wonder](https://i.imgur.com/ZNCb2eO.jpg)\n\n*Saw this in the airport, I wonder what happened there.*\n\n\n\nI had a coffee on the plane, it was terrible as well. What can I say, they‚Äôre being super consistent with their products.\n\n\n\nAvoid this airline please, if you can.\n\n\n\n## Arriving at Venice\n\n\n\nWe arrived at the airport in Venice after 2 hours, what struck me the most were two things:\n\n\n\n-   Air was moist\n\n-   Every sign had Chinese translations\n\n    \n\nMaybe there were many Chinese people visiting Venice? I had no idea.\n\n\n\n![signs](https://i.imgur.com/GdrcgyA.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Treviso\n\n\n\nI only knew a few things about our trip, I kinda wanted it to be a surprise as well by not knowing too much about the plan. R picked up a rental car which he would drive us all the way up north to the [[Dolomites]], where we were going to stay for the next 2 nights.\n\n\n\nWe didn‚Äôt have time to eat anything in the morning, so our first stop in Italy was a small city called [[Treviso]], not far from Venice. The three of us found a caf√© called Gastronomia Albertini, next to where our car was parked.\n\n\n\nSo far, we hadn‚Äôt had any situation where we needed to speak Italian, which none of us does anyway (R learned a few phrases on the plane). Treviso obviously being a non-tourist city, people don‚Äôt speak English, we gestured and guessed our way through the ordering process. The lovely lady who seemed to be the owner of the place, was super patient with us, after like 20 minutes of guesswork and a bit of Google Translate, we finally finished ordering.\n\n\n\nOver the years I had tried Raviolis a few times, I was never a fan, but I always thought for some reason this thing must be tasty, maybe it‚Äôs just because I never had good ones before. And I was correct, in that little caf√©, I finally had the first Ravioli I really liked.\n\n\n\n![rav](https://i.imgur.com/bAZEIXv.jpg)\n\n\n\nWalking around the canal after the meal, a force drew us closer and closer to another place, where they sell gelatos. You cannot have a meal without following up with gelato, at least not in Italy.\n\n\n\n![gel](https://i.imgur.com/xLLdrVa.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Driving North\n\n\n\nThe carbs struck hard after the meal. I asked R if he could stop somewhere to get a coffee, he agreed a coffee might be a good idea since it would be a 3-hour drive in the sunset.\n\n\n\nThe caf√© we went to had an Asian woman serving behind the bar, and there was an old and slightly drunk man having a wine, flirting with her casually. I felt sorry we had to break them up.\n\n\n\nWhile we were having the espresso there, I took a few moments to observe the situation. It seems like in a quiet countryside bar, the flirtation between a lonely barmaid and an old married man is more common than a fly swimming in a sweet summer drink.\n\n\n\nWhich reminded me of peaches. So I went next door, leaving my two friends at the scene, to buy some fruits for the evening.\n\n\n\nThe guy in the shop, who looked very comical because of his glasses and lovely smile, greeted me in Italian. We then got excited by the word London for a while, before I asked him about what local fruits he recommended, he called out a woman and asked me to repeat. I repeated but she couldn‚Äôt understand.\n\n\n\nAll right, time for Google. After hearing the robotic Italian from my phone, her eyes immediately lit up, and helped me choose a wide range of produce. I bought a butt load of fruits and meat.\n\n\n\n![peach](https://i.imgur.com/CZdjbY3.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Haunted House\n\n\n\nTowards the end of the journey we actually climbed in height, not very significant, and I slept through most of the journey. When I woke up, I realized we were resting just outside a petrol station. S felt hard to breathe, we waited until she felt more acclimated to the air pressure.\n\n\n\nSince we were very late, we were only left with an instruction on how to get into the house, but the address was wrong.\n\n\n\nAfter circling around a deserted house that looked like it came out of a horror film, we all agreed the house looked nothing like the picture.\n\n\n\nThere was literally no one around us, only the haunted house, dim light seeped through its broken windows and half sealed door. The air smelled of sheep manure. Oh no, we‚Äôre stuck in a murder town.\n\n\n\nRefuse to be buried there in animal shit, I checked the map again, turned out we are just a few streets away from the pinned location on Airbnb. Following the dot, we finally found our house.\n\n\n\nIt was less of a murder scene, but still it was too dark to see how it actually looked. The house was enormous, but we only booked two rooms, after a quick unpacking we found our own room and got ready to sleep.\n\n\n\nMy room was slightly underground, a bit damp, but manageable.\n\n\n\nSleeping without J was difficult, but after I turned off the lights, a cricket came in my room, and stayed with me the whole night.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.911480562Z","tags":null},"/Turning-32":{"title":"Turning 32","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![img](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454923634634-bd1614719a7b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026w=1740\u0026q=80)\n\n\n\n## Becoming an ambivert\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, it is my 32nd year living on this planet. \n\n\n\nI used to be this very shy, introverted guy who's really passionate about visual effects, and that was what I was doing most of my time. Last year, my passion for film VFX dimmed a little, and that bought me some time for other things in life. I became obsessed with meeting people, chatting away and walking in London streets like there's nothing else mattered.\n\n\n\nWhat I did find is after a long time of staying outside almost every day, staying in could be hard to do, which in turn makes doing things that require deep and sustained attention nearly impossible. It always seems like if you're not outside you're missing life, and right now it's London in summer, probably the best time of year you actually can get some sunlight. \n\n\n\nI've been fighting the urge to go outside every day, and luckily I started my second round of building my website, which is what you're visiting right now. After two weeks of intense focus now the website is 90% ready to use.\n\n\n\n## Trading\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I decided to become a trader, after months and months of market tuition (the phrase you use to describe a long term losing streak with a positive attitude) I finally see some signs of the turning point. \n\n\n\nIf you're curious, I mainly focus on day trading of small-cap stocks. No options, cryptos, or forex.\n\n\n\n## Leaving ILM\n\n\n\nLast year, just after my 31st birthday, I moved from film visual effects to game industry, this was a change I didn't really foresee coming. \n\n\n\nA new documentary series about ILM was released on Disney+ couple of days ago, being a fan of ILM and its team I got quite excited about it. I haven't watched the whole show yet, but here are some of the bits that ILM shared on the internet that really hit me.\n\n\n\n\u003e ILM was the place. A ‚ÄúLet's do something no one has ever seen before‚Äù attitude.\u003cbr\u003e-Robert Zemeckis\n\n\nAnd another quote from a former president of the company:\n\n\u003e Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be.\u003cbr\u003e-Lynwen Brennan\n\n\nThese were the reasons I was attracted to the studio and the industry, in some way, I was a bit like that to begin with. The idea of dropping out of high school and pursuing my dream, was kind of what I considered not a bold move, but the only sensible one. Not everyone has to walk the same way.\n\n\n\nWhen the idea of leaving ILM came to mind I hesitated, to me leaving ILM isn't about leaving the company, but whether I could carry on ‚Äúcreating the impossible‚Äù on my own, without surrounding myself with the people that inspire me so much. \n\n\n\nI paused a business idea because I thought it was impossible to execute, but recently I dug it up and started refining it. Then it dawned on me, leaving the comfort zone with the brilliant and talented people at ILM doesn't take the spirit away from me. \n\n\n\n## Life\n\n\n\nJasper sent me a post from someone on Instagram yesterday, it says:\n\n\n\n\u003e I love laughing with you, I love working with you, I love walking with you, I love talking with you, and I also love just existing with you, me being me and you being you.\n\n\nWe've been together for 4 years now, every day of our life feels like a river, quiet, nurturing and everlasting. He is everything I am not, and through the time trickling between and around us, from him, I learned kindness, sympathy, and contentment. We own two indoor cats, one black long hair girl called ‚ÄúLilith‚Äù and one ginger boy ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù (Lucy for short). Jasper being the proud father is very protective of these two children.\n\n\n\nI am on the autistic spectrum, and occasionally suffer from hyperfocus, loud noises and generally other human beings, but his presence has made my life a lot less problematic.\n\n\n\nEarly this year I was very depressed thanks to UK's award-winning weather in winter, luckily the restrictions were lifted, and I jumped on the plane to Tenerife island. Two weeks of sunshine on the beach was all I needed to survive the winter.\n\n\n\n## Before 33\n\n\n\nHopefully China is going to open up this year, I would love to go back to see my friends and family, and most important of all, all the food I have been missing.\n\n\n\nI would also push the business idea to see if it'll go anywhere. \n\n\n\nReading is what I strongly advocate for anyone, recently I haven't been reading much, but I would love to get back in the habit of reading more (this time maybe more fictions than non-fictions).\n\n\n\nPerhaps asking the world to be a better (not so crazy) place this year is a bit outstretched, so I wish everyone around me, my friends and family, good health and best of luck. People in London, hit me up and let's grab a beer or coffee!\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this far. ‚ù§\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.911480562Z","tags":null},"/Unreal-Engine":{"title":"Unreal Engine","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![img](https://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06_cinematic-copy.jpg)\n\n\n\nUnreal Engine is a real-time engine for [[Game]], [[VFX]] and [[Live Stage]] industries, created by [[Epic]] .\n\n\n\n[[Unreal Blueprint]]\n\n[[Unreal Materials]]\n\n[[Niagara System]]\n\n[[Unreal Lighting and Rendering]]\n\n[[Unreal Plugins]]\n\n[[Unreal Tips and Tricks]]\n\n[[Blueprints System]]\n\n\n\n\n\n## Topics\n\n[[Unreal Shading]]\n\n[[Unreal Water]]\n\n\n\n\n\n## üóÇ Resources \n\n\n\n[Asher.GG | git gud together](http://asher.gg/)\n\n\n\n## üì∫ Youtubers \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/UnrealEngine\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SmartPoly\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/unfgames\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DevEnabled\n\n\n\n[gameDev Outpost](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Yf1SuYLc5WdChEgXRA6OQ)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Playlists\n\n[Unreal Engine 4 by gameDev Outpost](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomQNLPOWtzbpKLbhlyYYneuoPfMgfE9f)\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.911480562Z","tags":null},"/VFX-MOC":{"title":"VFX MOC","content":"\n\n\n\n\n##### [[Home|Go to Home]]\n\n\n\n\n\n## üó∫ Map of Contents\n\n\n\n[[Colour Management]]\n\n\n\n[[Rigid Body Simulation]]\n\n[[Fluid Simulation]]\n\n[[Compositing]]\n\n\n\n## Industries\n\n[[Film and TV]]\n\n[[Game]]\n\n[[Motion Design]]\n\n[[Live Stage]]\n\n\n\n## Software\n\n[[Unreal Engine]]\n\n[[Houdini]]\n\n[[Nuke]]\n\n[[Redshift]]\n\n[[After Effects]]\n\n\n\n[[VFX Tips and Tricks]]\n\n\n\n## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Research\n\n\n\n[[Wave Function Collapse]]\n\n[[BOIDS]]\n\n\n\n## ‚ùì Open Questions\n\n\n\n## üóÇ Resources \n\n\n\n[GitHub - jedypod/vfx_good_night_reading: Curated collection of good reading about VFX and CG](https://github.com/jedypod/vfx_good_night_reading)\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T23:43:57.911480562Z","tags":null},"/What-Are-You-Looking-At-Book":{"title":"What Are You Looking At (Book)","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Cover|300](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XszgtCjqL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)\n\n\n\n## üìù Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About\n\n\n\nIn the tradition of¬†_Eats, Shoots \u0026 Leaves_, art history with a sense of humor  \n\n  \n\nEvery year, millions of museum and gallery visitors ponder the modern art on display and secretly ask themselves, \"Is this art?\" A former director at London's Tate Gallery and now the BBC arts editor, Will Gompertz made it his mission to bring modern art's exciting history alive for everyone, explaining why an unmade bed or a pickled shark can be art‚Äîand why a five-year-old couldn't really do it.
