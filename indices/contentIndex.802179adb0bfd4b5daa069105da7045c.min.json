The difference is when you gamble, the casino has an absolute edge of winning over yours, while designed to be deceptively random. \n\n\n\nYou might win once or twice, but over a large number of plays, the casino always wins. In order to win, you need to be the casino, not the gambler.\n\n\n\nProfitability = ( Wins% * Reward ) - ( Losses% * Risk )\n\n\n\nWhen you have a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, you really have to keep your winning probability above 33% to be profitable in the long run. Some people are more comfortable with higher risk-reward ratio such as 1:1, but with this ratio, you’ll have to keep winning probability above 50% to make a profit.\n\n\n\nGenerally, the winning probability of a system is inverse proportional to the risk-reward ratio. You cannot change the risk-reward ratio without affecting winning rate. So far, I haven’t seen any system or strategy that doesn’t follow this rule.\n\n\n\nHaving a strategy that has a genuine mathematical edge is crucial for trading success, luckily this is the easiest part to learn and develop within all the areas.\n\n\n\nThe outcome of any single trade is completely random, and it’s futile to try to predict it. What can be measured, predicted and acted on is the probability of one thing happening over the other in a series of trades.\n\n\n\n## **Back testing**\n\n\n\nIn case you don’t know already, back testing means testing your trading strategy with real historical price data to see how it performs. No matter what kind of strategy you decide to use, either you learned from others or developed on your own, bring it to test with real life historical data. \n\n\n\nThere are some ways of running back tests automatically via commercial apps, with a scripting language of your choice, or completely manually. As long as you have accurate historical data, you could test out how your strategy performs over a series of 50 trades, at least. \n\n\n\nProbability won’t work when you have a small set of samples.\n\n\n\nIf the result is not profitable over 50 trades, either make some changes to it, or just find another strategy, 50 trades are not a lot, but any solid strategy should at least give you a small profit at the end of that period.\n\n\n\n## **Risk of ruin**\n\n\n\nThere’s also an idea called \"Risk of Ruin\".\n\n\n\nAny chance of winning that’s less than exactly 100%, will give you losing trades, a probability of 50% of winning, statistically will have an 100% chance of generating 4 consecutive losing trades over 100 trades, and a 9% chance of generating 10 consecutive losing trades.\n\n\n\nLet this sink in, imagine yourself tossing a coin, and one after another you get a tail, for 10 times. How would you feel if every time it’s a tail you lose 3% of your whole account?\n\n\n\nYou need to accept it, because it will happen eventually.\n\n\n\nWith a 50% winning rate, you should expect to see a 10 trades long losing streak at some point, and it’s definitely not an indication that you’re trading badly.\n\n\n\nEncountering those losing streaks in the back testing stage before you start trading live, will help you learn how to deal with the negative feeling. Especially if the losing streak happens right at the beginning of live trading, it could be extremely hard to maintain your composure and keep trading the strategy exactly it should be traded, since you have no idea if there’s something wrong with the strategy or just the statistical inevitability.\n\n\n\nIt’s very important to keep this in mind, if you risk 5% of your remaining equity every time, in the event of this unfortunate 10 trades losing streak, you’ll have a 40% drawdown( 0.95 to the power of 10 ), if you risk 10%, that’ll be a 66% drawdown.\n\n\n\nAfter you have a 50% drawdown, you will need to make a 100% profit to break even.\n\n\n\nThe lower your winning rate is, the less you need to risk per trade so that these unforeseeable losing streaks don’t destroy your account.\n\n\n\n## **Try to break your strategy**\n\n\n\nIf your results in back testing proves that strategy could be profitable, try to break it by changing some parameters that define your strategy, in an ideal situation, the changes you make are going to affect the performance gradually, let’s say if you now tweak the distance between your entry point and stop loss point, together with the distance to take profit point so that they maintain the same ratio. \n\n\n\nJust by scaling up and down the distances, you’ll have different performance, you might find out with the distances shorter, it’s more likely to hit your stop loss and then reverse, or it might be too wide that a large number of trades couldn’t reach your take profit point before reversing. Your job is to find the optimal distances that maximise winning rate.\n\n\n\nIf you change the parameter gradually, but the results end up jumping up and down as if there’s no connection to the parameter you tweaked, then there might be a systematic flaw with your strategy. Ideally performance changes gradually and there is often an area that gives you the best performance.\n\n\n\n## **Paper trading**\n\n\n\nAfter thorough back testing and fine tuning the strategy, now you’re ready to trade, but I strongly advise you to do a forward testing.\n\n\n\nWhat is forward testing now?\n\n\n\nSimilar to back testing, but instead of using historical data, you’ll be using live data, testing your strategy as it happens. This is pretty much like live trading, but in a safe environment.\n\n\n\nIf you have access to a trading platform that provides paper trading accounts or trading simulators, it’ll be the best tool to forward test. They allow you to trade like a live account, but with fake money, and it’s great for testing your strategy.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have a platform to paper trade, there’s always the option to just do it on a charting software, TradingView for instance, allows you to place simulated trades on the chart. \n\n\n\n**_Forward testing provides a few benefits over back testing, such as:_**\n\n\n\n-   Back testing can’t simulate waiting time. In forward testing, you have to wait for the trades to resolve in their own time, you might have some doubts before a trade ends, and some people don’t have the patience to let it play out. \n\n\n\n-   Depending what instruments are designed to be used with the strategy, if you only have 1 concurrent trade allowed at any given moment, and you happen to see 2 or more trading opportunities, you can only choose one, this might affect the real performance. It’s hard to spot this when back testing.\n\n\n\n-   For part time traders, missing opportunities is normal, when you’re back testing you won’t find out that all those trades that happen around dinner time are actually not possible to execute, in forward testing you can.\n\n\n\n**_However even forward testing cannot give you the full experience as you would have in live trading:_**\n\n\n\n-   Simulators can’t simulate emotions which you will have when trading live, losing fake money probably feels like nothing other than a dent in your confidence, while losing real money might shake your whole belief in trading in general.\n\n\n\n-   For some fast trading styles such as scalping, slippage is frequent in live trading but simulators don’t include the impact of slippage.\n\n\n\n-   Size does matter in paper trading, one common mistake new traders make is to trade way bigger sizes and more aggressive than what they can afford in future live trading, not treating paper trading exactly like live trading is likely to encourage bad habits.\n\n\n\n## **Focus on one strategy**\n\n\n\nAt least at the beginning, juggling between several different strategies will only diverge your attention. \n\n\n\nLearning is a process of turning knowledge from consciousness into subconscious so you can utilise it naturally without thinking hard.\n\n\n\nI see trading as sports, there’s training and there’s competition. When you’re in the actual game competing with others, you’d better be sure you have all the techniques fully developed before jumping in. \n\n\n\nThat’s the worst time where you should be thinking about how to do certain things.\n\n\n\nThere are traders who constantly switch between different markets and trading styles, I would advise against trading like that when you’re starting out. If you want to add another strategy or trading style, do it after you’ve proven consistently profitable with one strategy.\n\n\n\n## **Pick strategies that fit your personality**\n\n\n\nThis is more about optimisation than validity, there are many strategies with proven profitability, but you might find most of them hard to adopt because how they are executed.\n\n\n\nSay you have a 9-5 job and only trade part time, a strategy that requires a lot of screen time during daytime is probably not for you.\n\n\n\nMaybe you are not comfortable to trade in a very fast fashion, then active day trading might not be a good fit.\n\n\n\nOr like myself, you seek quick action and more aggressive approach, swing trading is simply too slow to consider.\n\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n\n\nThe topics I listed above are just some of the important aspects in developing and adapting strategies that apply to most active traders, based on your own trading style you might have more or different components to check against. \n\n\n\nMake sure you understand all of these key points and find out which strategy you’ll be focusing on, is the first step forward. \n\n\n\nHow far are you now after you have figured all those things out? \n\n\n\nIf you agree with the consensus about how much importance strategies hold, then you are 10% there.\n\n\n\n\u003e Trading is 10% strategy, 30% risk management and 60% psychology.\n\n\n**I agree.**\n\n\n\nEspecially after blowing up my account twice.\n\n\n\nIn the next article let’s have a look at risk management, the art of keeping the money you made and not giving back everything when things go bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-07T14:40:01.595674917Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA series of articles on how to become the 3% of people who actually make consistent profit in the financial market.\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% - Unpacking the One Metric](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20Unpacking%20the%20One%20Metric.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% – Part 1 – Strategy](Becoming%20the%203%20P1%20Strategy.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% – Part 2 – Risk Management](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20P2%20Risk%20Management.md)\n\n\n\n[Becoming the 3% - Part 3 - Psychology](Becoming%20the%203%20Pct%20P3%20Psychology.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-07T14:40:01.595674917Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-P2-Risk-Management":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct P2 Risk Management","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% – Part 2 – Risk Management\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople always say survive before you thrive, for traders that’s particularly true.\n\n\n\nA common thread that runs through most of those successful traders is that, before they started producing consistent profit, they have all blown their accounts once or more times.\n\n\n\nIs it really inevitable on the journey to trading success? What exactly did they learn in the process?\n\n\n\nThey learned to respect risk management rules.\n\n\n\nHaving a strategy that promises profit is what draws people towards the market, but in the long run what keeps them in the market is risk management.\n\n\n\nManaging risks is the most widely agreed tenet across all types of trading communities. Without a proper risk management system, there is no way of protecting your profit from potential losses.\n\n\n\nNo matter how good your trading strategy is, if you don’t take risks seriously, one loss might have the potential to wipe you out. Without proper risk management, blowing up your account is inevitable, it’s just a matter of time when that happens. They don’t happen often, but when they do, they are normally catastrophic.\n\n\n\nHowever, tightening up losses is unarguably super hard to do.\n\n\n\n## **Are you calculating size correctly before entering a trade?**\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you want to approach position sizing, either by a percentage of your equity, or by a predetermined number of shares, as long as you have a system for it, respect it and follow it rigorously.\n\n\n\nNo trade at any given moment should hold the power to completely eliminate your account, meaning you should always calculate your trading size so that even when the worst case scenario happens, you are still left with most of the account.\n\n\n\n## **Are you cutting your losses when the trades go against you?**\n\n\n\nIf you have trouble cutting the loss, are you using an automatic stop loss order?\n\n\n\nLetting losers run and cutting winners early is one of the main reasons people are not profitable.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most common mistake people make, and it’s the easiest to fix on paper, most traders’ poor performance could be drastically improve just by cutting losses earlier, it could turn a losing trader into a winning one just by doing that alone.\n\n\n\nPersonally I am guilty of this too. If you stand next to me and force me to cut my bad losing trades, it will almost completely eliminate my losing days.\n\n\n\nI won’t pretend it’s easy to learn this, the reason behind this is that we don’t want to admit being wrong. Unrealised loss has the potential to turn around and becomes profit, cutting the loss destroys any possibility of turning it around, and we will be forced to accept defeat, at least this one trade.\n\n\n\nBut in my experience, cutting the loss earlier is never worse than holding, yes sometimes it does turn around and you might exit break even or even make a profit, majority of the time they just keep going and going, until the pain is too intense to keep holding and we’re forced to exit at our max loss threshold.\n\n\n\nAfter that, there’s always the same regret, why didn’t I cut the trade earlier?\n\n\n\nCut your losing trades earlier.\n\n\n\n## **Are you giving the trades time to develop according to your trading plan?**\n\n\n\nIt may feel like there’s nothing wrong with taking profit before it hits your profit target, in some cases yes, but you have to understand if you’re constantly taking profit too soon, you might miss a lot of profit potential.\n\n\n\nIn a well back tested system where a pre-defined set of rules are set and balanced to generate a stable profitability over a large number of samples, taking profit too early might skew the overall P/L towards negative. Since you’re always letting losses reach the max, but cutting profit short, in the long run, you’ll damage profitability.\n\n\n\n## **Are your positions correlated?**\n\n\n\nSome of your concurrent positions might be deep down correlated, if that’s the case, when one experiences a drawdown, the others will do the same. This could be a big issue, let’s say you are risking 3% of your equity per trade, and you have 5 open positions.\n\n\n\nIf they’re correlated and turn out to be losers, you’re losing 15% of your equity. It’ll behave more like a 15% risk trade instead of 5 trades that are risking 3%.\n\n\n\nA small losing streak might take you out.\n\n\n\nFind out how much they’re correlated before you get in trades that happen at the same time.\n\n\n\nStocks that belong to the same sector, forex pairs that are using the same base currencies, or ETFS that are tracking the same industries.\n\n\n\nEither diversify the instruments or lower the risks per trade.\n\n\n\n## **Are you taking events into consideration?**\n\n\n\nEvents such as earnings or governmental financial reports could have big impacts on how prices move.\n\n\n\nThese events create a lot of volatility but they are unpredictable. Especially those trades that are using automatic stop loss orders, when these kind of events happen price can make huge sudden moves and that might trigger your stoploss and then reverse and go the other way.\n\n\n\nIf you’re not sure how much of an impact any certain event has on your trades, it’s better to just not trade.\n\n\n\n## **Are you only taking the best quality trades?**\n\n\n\nWhen the overall market is experiencing a drawdown such as right now in February 2022, there could be a severe decrease in trading opportunities for some strategies.\n\n\n\nOut of boredom, some traders start to trade B or C quality trading setups that are most likely to hurt performance on average.\n\n\n\nIt’s funny to think trading is different to other businesses in a way that when we are trading we control how to sell and buy independently.\n\n\n\nJust like selling umbrellas and ice creams, naturally the sale of such items is heavily affected by the weather on a large scale. It’s not to say you can’t sell ice cream in winter, just the profit potential is much less than selling hot tea.\n\n\n\nIn a declining market condition, long biases traders are collectively resistant in buying and taking risks when price is struggling to break certain threshold, resulting in bears winning most battles.\n\n\n\nRecognising what kind of market you’re in helps you fine tune your strategy to maximise profit potential and avoid big losses.\n\n\n\nForcing a trade in a subpar market condition is in fact taking more risk for less gain.\n\n\n\n## **But why is it so hard to do?**\n\n\n\nSuccessful risk management sounds easy on paper, but most traders fail at following it. The reason isn’t that the risk management rules are not clear or technically hard to execute.\n\n\n\nIt’s ourselves that we cannot control.\n\n\n\nBeing in a trade is exactly like being in a romantic relationship, giving other people advice is a piece of cake, but when it comes to your own trading(or relationship), you are suddenly blind to all the flaws and mistakes you would’ve clearly see if it were happening to others.\n\n\n\nIn the next article we will have a look at the common areas that trip people over all the time in their own head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-07T14:40:01.595674917Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-P3-Psychology":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct P3 Psychology","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% - Part 3 - Psychology \n\n\n\nSome people are born with the right aptitudes for becoming a good trader, these lucky people are:\n\n\n\n-   **disciplined**, once a clear rule is set, they respect and follow it rigorously without exception.\n\n-   **brave**, enough to not be affected by doubt and second guessing.\n\n-   **decisive**, able to pull the trigger when it’s needed, fast without hesitation.\n\n-   **calm**, because they know how a trading strategy works and won’t be agitated by the small ups and downs, and they’re able to maintain composure in a losing streak.\n\n-   **objective**, they can think in probability and large numbers, distinguish facts and opinions.\n\n-   **resilient**, it’s not uncommon for a trader to get knocked down by the market many times, they are able to reset, readjust and retry no matter what.\n\n-   **honest**, most profitable traders only have 65% accuracy, they are wrong 35% of time on average, you have to honestly admit you’re wrong and be okay with it, being profitable has nothing to do with being right all the time.\n\n\n\nThese attributes don’t come naturally to most people, but they are exactly what we need to aim for when training to be a trader.\n\n\n\nI would consider obtaining a good level of these qualities to be a substantial step towards being a professional trader.\n\n\n\n## **Keeping a trading journal**\n\n\n\nA while ago I started taking notes for all the trades I made, since then, my trading performance saw some drastic improvement. It seems like the action of writing down your thoughts about the trades every day, really burns the idea in your head.\n\n\n\nWhen I am in the middle of active trading I sometimes get very emotional, writing it down either right after I have the feeling or after I finish trading, helps me recognise and address those problems.\n\n\n\nI still make mistakes I would like to stop making, but keeping a journal at least helps me visualise my progress and forces me to be honest with myself, it could be enhanced by sharing them to other traders too.\n\n\n\nJust in case you’re curious, I use Tradervue to record all my trades and every day I write down a detailed journal of what I trade, how I trade. You don’t really need a dedicated journal software to do this, any notebook app or even pen and paper would do.\n\n\n\n**There are 4 things I keep track of mainly:**\n\n\n\n-   **market condition**, I write this before I take any trade if possible.\n\n-   **mental state**, am I too eager? Distracted? Fearful? Agitated? Calm?\n\n-   **performance**, here is detailed walk through of the whole trading day.\n\n-   **to improve**, after finishing the trading day, I write down all the things I could’ve done better today and remind myself next day.\n\n\n\nHowever you might decide to track and reflect different areas based on your trading style, instrument and time frame.\n\n\n\nOne trader I look up to a lot once said, almost all of the best traders keep detailed record of their trades, some also plan ahead before they trade on paper. If you ask them about their accuracy, profit loss ratio, risk parameters, they will know all the metrics by heart.\n\n\n\n\u003e “I find it hard to take a developing trader seriously who isn’t keeping a detailed daily trading journal.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Mike Bellafiore, SMB Capital\n\n\nTo solve a problem you must first acknowledge the problem, I recommend that you start your trading journals if you haven’t already, better late than never.\n\n\n\n## **Avoiding FOMO**\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone is having constant battle with it, the fear of missing out.\n\n\n\nThe problem that comes with FOMO is destructive, when a price move went without you and you start to chase, you’ll most likely to enter a trade, either long or short, on the extension, a place where it’s most likely to follow up with a pullback. If this move is then proven lack of conviction, it might not even be a pullback anymore. Worst case scenario that’s the furthest spot it could go, before shooting in the opposite direction with high momentum.\n\n\n\nEven if it is a pullback, you might decide to wait for it to come back to your entry price. It could happen, but it could just as well keep going in the other direction.\n\n\n\nYou’ll be trapped in the trade and forced to liquidate the position with a big loss.\n\n\n\nThe moment we feel FOMO kicking in, more often than not, is precisely the end of the momentum. The more impressive the move is, the more your FOMO would be, the more likely a reversal is due.\n\n\n\n## **Be selective**\n\n\n\nA good trader learns and accepts the fact that there are cycles in the market, the bull, the bear and the consolidation, not every type of market is suitable to trade with your strategy.\n\n\n\nNot trading in a market that’s less favourable for your strategy could be very hard, but most traders will agree that sitting through those period in cash, is often the best move.\n\n\n\nBeing selective also means choosing between a bunch of different stocks or currencies, sometimes we are so fixated on the technical patterns we detected on the chart, that we become blind to other factors that define a good trade, be it wrong time of day, lack of volume or historical false attempts.\n\n\n\nFailing to perform a full check on the stock and trade idea is at best a waste of time, if you get good result out of a bad trade, you’ll be encouraged to break the rules again, sooner or later your accuracy will suffer and likely generate big losses. Worst of all, you might lose confidence and when there are finally good opportunities you have become too afraid to act on them.\n\n\n\nTrade the best and leave the rest.\n\n\n\n## **Revenge trading**\n\n\n\nA few scenarios will trigger a trader to act recklessly:\n\n\n\n-   missing a trade that moves in your favour but you’re too late to get in.\n\n-   price hits your stop loss and then immediately reverses to your intended direction and hits your original profit target price.\n\n-   losing more than half of your profit.\n\n-   starting with profit then becomes losses.\n\n-   one trade that wipes your profits from many trades.\n\n\n\nPersonally if I start the day with profit and then turn negative, I would be very annoyed and likely to start revenge trading, the trajectory after that is normally a nosedive into the red abyss, digging a hole that will take me days to recover, if I’m lucky.\n\n\n\nLearning to recognise those triggers and being able to act early to stop yourself descending deeper and deeper into the bad situation would drastically trim down your biggest red days(weeks or months depending on your trading frequency), which also means an easier time to recover.\n\n\n\n## **Dollar amount vs percentage**\n\n\n\nWhenever I can, I try to focus on my performance in percentage instead of in dollar amount.\n\n\n\nA loss can look big but when put into perspective in relation to the account size, it might just be 3% of your equity. To me, losing 3% feels much better than losing 3000 dollars, when you have a 100,000 account.\n\n\n\nMost people, even us traders, will equate dollars to stuff they can and want to buy, so 3000 dollars could be the beautiful camera or the trip to Iceland you have always wanted, and you just threw it away.\n\n\n\nHowever a 3% drawdown is considered very acceptable to most traders.\n\n\n\nWhile your account is constantly growing, the dollar amount is also changing, seeing the progress in percentage helps you normalise performance, if you can score a 3% profit every day, after 6 months of trading it’ll be 34 times of your starting point.\n\n\n\nTechnically a 3K dollars profit with a 100K account and a 30 dollars profit with a 1000 account, is exactly the same in terms of performance, the implication is that if you can do well with 3% with a small account, while 30 dollars may look insignificant, you prove you are equipped with the good knowledge and techniques to do well with a larger account.\n\n\n\nKeeping track of this percentage you’ll also have a clear idea when and where you’re deviating from the baseline performance, are you getting sloppy and over confident, or not being able to strictly following your own rules? They are all going to reflect on the history of percentage.\n\n\n\n## **Quality of trades**\n\n\n\nHere’s another problem, even percentage could be misleading sometimes, especially in a choppy market, you need to be extra careful of what to trade and what to leave alone. The market doesn’t care about your P/L or trading setups, so even percentage of gain is really out of your control, what you can control though, is the quality of the trade.\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a discretionary strategy in which you organically come up with stop loss and take profit levels as the trade unfolds, you should base your reaction on the technicals of the trade itself, not how much money you want to take out of the market.\n\n\n\nIf price is clearly heading towards a strong resistance level, it would be wrong to hope it’ll break through. You should either not enter the trade, or enter the trade but exit before reaching the danger zone.\n\n\n\nAgain, the market doesn’t know or care if you hit your 3% daily goal or not, it does what it wants.\n\n\n\n## **Commissions**\n\n\n\nIf you’re an active day trader using a small account, some brokers charge you commissions that’s just not proportional to the account size. If you can only make 10 dollars with appropriate position size, and the commissions for a buy and a sell cost you 5 dollars, you are not going to make money. You’ll only have half of profit left, at the same time all your losses are much bigger after commissions.\n\n\n\nUnless you have amazing accuracy and risk control, even profits sometimes end up losses because the high commissions weigh down the whole level. As a beginner trader, having a consistent break-even performance is already a challenge.\n\n\n\nSo how do you deal with this mentally?\n\n\n\nI have been struggling with this as well. The best thing to do is to ignore the commissions, don’t even think about the net P/L after commissions. What you should be focusing on is practising discipline and consistency, not the amount of money you make. The amount of drawdown incurred by the commissions will automatically ease off when you start trading larger sizes.\n\n\n\nWhat you definitely don’t want to do, is to change the way you trade to combat the impact. You need to practise the strategy as if you are trading normal size, distorting the rules to accommodate a small account will give you distorted results. Having a habit built on distorted rules is very dangerous when you switch to a big account.\n\n\n\nAlthough, there is one valid optimisation you can adopt, which is to limit the quantity of trades so you don’t waste commissions. Not only that, it also has the benefit of forcing you to only trade the best setups and be extremely selective, since you don’t want to waste your only trade on opportunities less than ideal.\n\n\n\n## **Transition to live account from paper account**\n\n\n\nMark Douglas said something that made me look at paper trading from a completely different angle, I’ll paraphrase what he said because I can’t find the original quote.\n\n\n\n“Paper trading result is the performance you could have if you operate without fear, greed and other psychological blocks.”\n\n\n\nI sometimes wish someone secretly swaps my paper account with live account, I think I would’ve have much better result by thinking I am trading a simulator than live.\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone experience this dip in performance when switching to live account from paper, suddenly all those numbers in unrealised P/L start to have huge impact in psychology, decision making can be seriously damaged if greed and fear come in.\n\n\n\nOne popular advice is to start small, granted that trading is a risky business and losing is inevitable, but a small account will reduce the likelihood of losing emotional control.\n\n\n\nMake sure all the potential losses are not something you can’t make back in one or two days, if you put one month’s salary worth of money to the account, losing 3-5% per day will probably be all right since it’s money you can make back in a few days. At least to me personally, that’s the level I am comfortable with emotionally.\n\n\n\nIf you are day trading like me, with a broker that charges commissions on each trade, then the account can’t be too small either, as I said before, the sizes should be high enough so that commissions won’t completely eliminate potential profits.\n\n\n\nOnce you’re trading live, don’t go back to simulation if you can still afford it. Going back and forth between live and simulation is generally not a good idea since you might perform better again in the simulator and then come back to live, experience the fear and lose again. Quite a lot of people get stuck in this vicious circle.\n\n\n\nSimulation should be stopped once you have mastered the technical side of trading such as putting orders, exiting positions, managing stop loss and take profit, etc. After you are able to identify and execute trading setups, you shouldn’t really go back to simulation as long as you can afford staying in live account.\n\n\n\nIf your psychology is the reason why you have bad trading results, then going back to simulation isn’t going to provide any real solutions, since simulation can’t really simulate emotions you’d have in live trading, the best it can provide is reaffirming your strategy works, which is already proven in the strategy development and validation period anyway.\n\n\n\nThe only way forward is to face your fear and greed directly, accept loss and defeat objectively, work on it patiently, day after day, little by little, focus on gradual improvements which eventually turn to consistent profitability.\n\n\n\nI have just lost 20% of my account yesterday, it was painful, and it wasn’t anyone’s fault but mine. Monetary loss is not fun, but what I care about most is how much I follow and respect my own rules, because that is the only thing I can control.\n\n\n\n## **Putting it together**\n\n\n\nA common false belief, although I wish it to be true, is that there’s an Ah Ha moment, an epiphany, or a click, that sends a struggling trader directly to the heaven of profitability. Unfortunately from what I gathered, that is not the case.\n\n\n\nThere has almost never been one moment that has the power to completely enables a trader to become a millionaire, unless you YOLO into a wall street bet and lucky enough to win, but that’s gambling, we are trying to be traders, not gamblers.\n\n\n\nTraders need to go through a lot of trials and errors, to finally turn those habitual self destructive behaviour to consistently profitable trading.\n\n\n\nPerformance of a great dancer might make you feel like dancing is easy, the fluid and effortless movement is a facade, what really happens underneath is hundreds of muscles working hard to maintain the look of elegance on the surface.\n\n\n\nSome of the elements could become second nature after years of practice, but to perform consistently well every time still requires undivided attention, focus and vigilance.\n\n\n\n## **Visualisation**\n\n\n\nIf you’re a visual person like me, it’s not a crazy idea to list all the areas and sub areas you want to improve upon, in terms of process, not results.\n\n\n\nSay you want to limit the times you FOMO into a trade, put a FOMO column on a spreadsheet and each day you start a new row and colour the corresponding slot based on how well you did that day.\n\n\n\nOr you want to track how well you cut losing trades timely and ruthlessly, put a column for it and keep evaluating this metric every day.\n\n\n\nOver time you will see a cloud of data points that demonstrate your dedication, determination and perseverance, shifting in colour from the behaviours you want to avoid, to those that represent a professional trader.\n\n\n\nProfitability is only possible after you become fully responsible for your own actions and not blame the market for anything. The market is too big for you to control, what you can control though, is how well you respect these rules.\n\n\n\n\u003e Focus on process and results will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-07T14:40:01.595674917Z","tags":null},"/Becoming-the-3-Pct-Unpacking-the-One-Metric":{"title":"Becoming the 3 Pct Unpacking the One Metric","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Becoming the 3% - Unpacking the One Metric\n\n\n\n\n\n## **The One Metric - P/L**\n\n\n\nWhen you’re still learning to trade and yet to be profitable, finding out a way to check if you’re on the right track is super important to your future trading success.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, all trading performances could be judged by one metric, and that is whether you’re profitable during a period of time or not. A positive P/L means you’re good at trading, a negative one means you’re a bad trader.\n\n\n\nIt might look binary if you just focus on the P/L, but the reality is, to be a consistently profitable trader, one has to do a lot of things right to have an edge in the market. This is one of those cases that can be explained with the classic wooden barrel theory, if you have even one shortcoming, it might be the one that destroys you and prevents you from being successful at trading.\n\n\n\n## **Rocket Building**\n\n\n\nHave you ever watched a rocket launch event? There are only two major outcomes, successful or failed. But when the launch process itself fails, no one would ever doubt the work being put behind the scenes. Even if you don’t know anything about building a rocket, it won’t be hard to understand that, the process of a rocket launch is merely executing a plan that’s been carefully designed beforehand.\n\n\n\nTrading should follow the same logic, when you’re executing a trade, it would be simply following a trading plan that’s been prepared in advance. Your ability to form such plans would be equivalent to the work that goes into building the rocket itself and launch procedures, without the essential work on the individual components that make up the rocket or the trader, the final product won’t be able to withstand the ever changing market.\n\n\n\n## **Areas of focus**\n\n\n\nSo how do we evaluate progress before you are consistently profitable?\n\n\n\nInstead of looking at the final P/L of every day, every week, every month, we should focus on different components required to trade properly.\n\n\n\nWhen we start to break down the areas where an aspiring trader needs to improve, suddenly that one binary metric expands to an array of quantitative(relatively) attributes and goals to measure against.\n\n\n\nIt is a well-known fact that there are 3 cornerstones in any profitable trading:\n\n\n\n-   Strategy\n\n-   Risk management\n\n-   Psychology\n\n\n\nEach category contains many aspects a trader needs to work on before they can achieve long term success.\n\n\n\nI will break down each one of them in the future posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-07T14:40:01.595674917Z","tags":null},"/Blueprints-System":{"title":"Blueprints System","content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## UI\n\n\n\nI really don't like Unreal Engine's UI design, everything looks very chunky and full of visual distractions.
