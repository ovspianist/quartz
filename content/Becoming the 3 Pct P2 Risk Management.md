# Becoming the 3% – Part 2 – Risk Management





People always say survive before you thrive, for traders that’s particularly true.



A common thread that runs through most of those successful traders is that, before they started producing consistent profit, they have all blown their accounts once or more times.



Is it really inevitable on the journey to trading success? What exactly did they learn in the process?



They learned to respect risk management rules.



Having a strategy that promises profit is what draws people towards the market, but in the long run what keeps them in the market is risk management.



Managing risks is the most widely agreed tenet across all types of trading communities. Without a proper risk management system, there is no way of protecting your profit from potential losses.



No matter how good your trading strategy is, if you don’t take risks seriously, one loss might have the potential to wipe you out. Without proper risk management, blowing up your account is inevitable, it’s just a matter of time when that happens. They don’t happen often, but when they do, they are normally catastrophic.



However, tightening up losses is unarguably super hard to do.



## **Are you calculating size correctly before entering a trade?**



It doesn’t matter how you want to approach position sizing, either by a percentage of your equity, or by a predetermined number of shares, as long as you have a system for it, respect it and follow it rigorously.



No trade at any given moment should hold the power to completely eliminate your account, meaning you should always calculate your trading size so that even when the worst case scenario happens, you are still left with most of the account.



## **Are you cutting your losses when the trades go against you?**



If you have trouble cutting the loss, are you using an automatic stop loss order?



Letting losers run and cutting winners early is one of the main reasons people are not profitable.



This is one of the most common mistake people make, and it’s the easiest to fix on paper, most traders’ poor performance could be drastically improve just by cutting losses earlier, it could turn a losing trader into a winning one just by doing that alone.



Personally I am guilty of this too. If you stand next to me and force me to cut my bad losing trades, it will almost completely eliminate my losing days.



I won’t pretend it’s easy to learn this, the reason behind this is that we don’t want to admit being wrong. Unrealised loss has the potential to turn around and becomes profit, cutting the loss destroys any possibility of turning it around, and we will be forced to accept defeat, at least this one trade.



But in my experience, cutting the loss earlier is never worse than holding, yes sometimes it does turn around and you might exit break even or even make a profit, majority of the time they just keep going and going, until the pain is too intense to keep holding and we’re forced to exit at our max loss threshold.



After that, there’s always the same regret, why didn’t I cut the trade earlier?



Cut your losing trades earlier.



## **Are you giving the trades time to develop according to your trading plan?**



It may feel like there’s nothing wrong with taking profit before it hits your profit target, in some cases yes, but you have to understand if you’re constantly taking profit too soon, you might miss a lot of profit potential.



In a well back tested system where a pre-defined set of rules are set and balanced to generate a stable profitability over a large number of samples, taking profit too early might skew the overall P/L towards negative. Since you’re always letting losses reach the max, but cutting profit short, in the long run, you’ll damage profitability.



## **Are your positions correlated?**



Some of your concurrent positions might be deep down correlated, if that’s the case, when one experiences a drawdown, the others will do the same. This could be a big issue, let’s say you are risking 3% of your equity per trade, and you have 5 open positions.



If they’re correlated and turn out to be losers, you’re losing 15% of your equity. It’ll behave more like a 15% risk trade instead of 5 trades that are risking 3%.



A small losing streak might take you out.



Find out how much they’re correlated before you get in trades that happen at the same time.



Stocks that belong to the same sector, forex pairs that are using the same base currencies, or ETFS that are tracking the same industries.



Either diversify the instruments or lower the risks per trade.



## **Are you taking events into consideration?**



Events such as earnings or governmental financial reports could have big impacts on how prices move.



These events create a lot of volatility but they are unpredictable. Especially those trades that are using automatic stop loss orders, when these kind of events happen price can make huge sudden moves and that might trigger your stoploss and then reverse and go the other way.



If you’re not sure how much of an impact any certain event has on your trades, it’s better to just not trade.



## **Are you only taking the best quality trades?**



When the overall market is experiencing a drawdown such as right now in February 2022, there could be a severe decrease in trading opportunities for some strategies.



Out of boredom, some traders start to trade B or C quality trading setups that are most likely to hurt performance on average.



It’s funny to think trading is different to other businesses in a way that when we are trading we control how to sell and buy independently.



Just like selling umbrellas and ice creams, naturally the sale of such items is heavily affected by the weather on a large scale. It’s not to say you can’t sell ice cream in winter, just the profit potential is much less than selling hot tea.



In a declining market condition, long biases traders are collectively resistant in buying and taking risks when price is struggling to break certain threshold, resulting in bears winning most battles.



Recognising what kind of market you’re in helps you fine tune your strategy to maximise profit potential and avoid big losses.



Forcing a trade in a subpar market condition is in fact taking more risk for less gain.



## **But why is it so hard to do?**



Successful risk management sounds easy on paper, but most traders fail at following it. The reason isn’t that the risk management rules are not clear or technically hard to execute.



It’s ourselves that we cannot control.



Being in a trade is exactly like being in a romantic relationship, giving other people advice is a piece of cake, but when it comes to your own trading(or relationship), you are suddenly blind to all the flaws and mistakes you would’ve clearly see if it were happening to others.



In the next article we will have a look at the common areas that trip people over all the time in their own head.
