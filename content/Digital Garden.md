Even a brilliant idea in the shower would quickly vanish the moment you step out of the bathroom. It also has something to do with our memories are strongly tied to the situation where it comes from.

A system that enable us to capture our fleeting thoughts is not only beneficial for de-stressing our mind, but also crucial for us to navigate the world in constant information overload. 

## Public Writing

Writing and presenting stuff online could be terrifying, the idea of a published piece carries a lot of responsibilities, however using a system like digital garden changes people's expectation towards the articles they see, it's also good for being not such a perfectionist, you know you can always change the text, and you should update and polish as you go along.
