> What exactly is digital gardening?


If you don't know what digital gardens are, just think of it as a personal Wikipedia. To keep a digital garden, the end goal isn't having perfectly written articles, instead the process of slowly growing the interconnected knowledge is what digital gardening really cares about.



Our brains are very good at generating ideas, but sucks at holding the information for a longer period of time. Even a brilliant idea in the shower would quickly vanish the moment you step out of the bathroom. The reason has something to do with how our memories are stored.



A system that enable us to capture our fleeting thoughts is not only beneficial for de-cluttering our mind, but also crucial for us to navigate the world in a constant information overload. 



## Public Writing



Writing and presenting stuff online could be terrifying, the idea of a published piece carries a lot of responsibilities. However, using a system like digital garden changes people's expectation towards the articles they see, it's also good for being not such a perfectionist: you know you can always change the text, in fact, you should update and polish as you go along. 



The most important thing about writing is the act of writing, I remember Hemingway once said, write drunk, edit sober. Writing is kind of hard, but if you accept the fact that first drafts are going to be bad, and you can always make changes later down the line, it frees up the writer.



## A Second Brain



[Building A Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book) by Tiago Forte is in some way related to the topic of digital gardening in a sense that both methods are encouraging the accumulation and constant reshaping of [[Atomic Notes]]. The method focuses on the process of making ideas stand on their own, as well as making connections between them.
