# Welcome!

This is my blog, my thoughts, my [Digital Garden](notes/Digital%20Garden.md).

Everything I am interested in studying would be listed here if you're curious about it, the search bar above is also useful to find certain pages.

Pretty much all the pages you could find here are considered as work in progress, or [Evergreen Notes](notes/Evergreen%20Notes.md), they represent my current level of interests and understanding on the topic, they are by no means the complete thoughts, but if you see anything you are particularly interested in and would like to read more, please drop a message through any of the social links from my main [website](https://cniu.art), I would try to work more on those.

## Main Focus


On the professional side of things, I use [Unreal Engine](notes/Unreal%20Engine.md) for game design and [Houdini](notes/Houdini.md) for visual effects. Sometimes I use a bit of [Coding](notes/Coding.md) to help with my art creation workflow and other areas in life.

I am a big fan of [Productivity](notes/Productivity.md) and [Creativity](notes/Creativity.md) in general, but I have a few favourite areas I would go deeper into in the future.

Thoughts about [Trading](notes/Trading.md) and some other [Random Thoughts](notes/Random%20Thoughts.md)

Books I'm [Currently Reading](notes/Currently%20Reading.md).

## Other Interests

Well, these are mostly the rabbit holes I find myself digging into from time to time. 

Being a foodie, I spend most of my outdoor time eating in restaurants, here are some  [restaurants I recommend](notes/Restaurants%20I%20recommend.md) in London.
