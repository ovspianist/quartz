There is an interesting grammar variant in English that has caused me confusion. When you want to express the statement that "everything is green" is not true, how do you say it?

Do you say "not everything is green" or "everything is not green"? 

I know quite a lot of people would use the latter expression for such ideas. Unfortunately my brain doesn't naturally equate "everything is not" as "not everything is", "everything is not" in my head always sounds like "nothing is", which is to say that the entirety of the items we refer to is not something. 

A quick search on [[Google Books Ngram Viewer]] shows that usage of the latter expression is actually going out of fashion in recent years. The popularity of "everything is not" started growing since 1800 until since 1900 "not everything is" started to gain popularity. 

Since 1980, there are more documented usage of "not everything is" than that of "everything is not".

So be a good socialist and use "not everything is".
