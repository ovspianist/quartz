## ℹ️ About



In the tradition of _Eats, Shoots & Leaves_, art history with a sense of humor  

  

Every year, millions of museum and gallery visitors ponder the modern art on display and secretly ask themselves, "Is this art?" A former director at London's Tate Gallery and now the BBC arts editor, Will Gompertz made it his mission to bring modern art's exciting history alive for everyone, explaining why an unmade bed or a pickled shark can be art—and why a five-year-old couldn't really do it. Rich with extraordinary tales and anecdotes, _What Are You Looking At_? entertains as it arms readers with the knowledge to truly understand and enjoy what it is they’re looking at.
