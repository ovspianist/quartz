We live in a world of constant information overload, how do we live and work in a way that's both effective and manageable? 

Productivity is one of my deepest interests since I was a child, I'm super lazy when it comes to working and studying, don't get me wrong, I like to get a lot of things done, but I prefer to do it as easily as possible.

Here are a few of the categories I am interested in and always seek to improve for myself, and to share them to help other people as well.

## Note-taking

A good note-taking routine not only helps keeping and extracting information, another benefit people don't realize is that just by pushing information around, new ideas could be found in the process, and sometimes they are extremely fortuitous and creative.

My current method is something known as [[Zettelkasten]], or "slip box".
