# Becoming British



On my way to the visa center where I am going to submit my application to become a British citizen, it feels like an important moment of my life. Having lived here in the UK for 9 years, I have decided to switch. 



This action means I will have to give up my Chinese citizenship, one that is impossible to recover even if I wanted to. 



Because of this, many Chinese people I know who hold an ILR here in the UK remain so, reluctant to give up the Chinese passport, keep paying and spending a lot of time in applying entry visas for almost all countries they want to visit. 



Such is the burden of the first generation immigrants. Giving up the citizenship where your parents still live is a hard decision to make. 



## The One Direction



During the past 3 years when China enforced a zero covid policy, entering the country became super hard, even if you have a Chinese passport. Strict quarantine rules, frequent flight cancellations and unofficial reasons for entry rejections, among other obstacles, made me rethink the validity of even holding onto Chinese passport. 



Many things over the past few years clearly demonstrated this particular country doesn’t love its people. In fact, people are nothing more than mere dispensable resources.



I do not like America, but my impression is that if you hold an American passport, you have a strong backing. I certainly don’t think of my Chinese passport this way. A few months ago, during a demonstration outside Chinese embassy in the UK, some of the officers dragged the demonstrators into the embassy and violently beat them. The victims were Chinese as well. 



The direction where China is headed remains a mystery to me, the decisions of a single mind by definition is always going to be harder to predict than those of a collective. 



But since 2012, due to my particular interests and ways of working, I saw clearly how much of basic rights were taken away from us, year after year. On the surface, the economic growth was way too successful for most people to even notice the slippery slop on which freedom was taken away. 



I still remember the days, living in Shenzhen, we had the whole shebang of Internet. Google, Youtube, Facebook and of course, Vimeo. Among other websites and services that were crucial for our industry. It didn’t take long for us to lose all of those. At one point even Github was banned. What the actual fuck.



So even if I don’t know where exactly China is going, the direction never changed since 2012, and it worries me. 



## How about family?



Indeed this is still my biggest concern, but I do know many people who switched and, as a result, have given up the Chinese citizenship. 



It probably won’t be easy, but China is going either route on the border control front. 



### A. Remains tight control and discourages people from entering. 



I won’t be surprised if this is the case, wont make any sense but it could happens. In this case, even holding a Chinese passport doesn’t do you any better. 



### B. Opens up and encourages people to live and work in China. 



In which case it wouldn’t matter which passport you hold, getting a visa should be quite straightforward like how it used to be. 



All I’m saying is, if you legitimately need to swap for either personal or professional reasons, do not let this unpredictable government hinder your choices. 



Instead my focus is on becoming more and more free, financially, legally. So that if real tough choices are upon my shoulder, I will have earned myself more leeway in navigating such scenarios. 



For casual visits, I don’t think it would matter that much. 



## If you are facing the dilemma and don’t know what to do



Ask people who have made the switch and see how they deal with it. Or, you can reach out to me, I would be happy to discuss with you. 



I might be biased, but my bias on this matter never proved me wrong yet. So maybe they’re not biases.
