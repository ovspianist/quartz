[[Zettelkasten]] is a German word for "slip box", the phrase was coined by [[Niklas Luhmann]] who was a prolific social scientist in Germany, he published 50 books and over 600 articles in his lifetime, his work was the result of his note-taking and writing system Zettelkasten, it is the equivalent of [[Hypertext]] that we use every day on the internet. The method uses an analogue system that allows him to hyper-connect the index cards that he wrote his ideas on that literally sat inside cabinet drawers, hence the name "slip box". 



## Work smart



My biggest find this year is [[Obsidian]], this app has become my one and only note-taking app and the core component to my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system.  



Obsidian allows you to write in [[Markdown]] format notes locally, and easily connect them using Wiki links, a double bracket surrounding something turns it into a link, which you can then elaborate further on that page.
