## Becoming an ambivert



All of a sudden, it is my 32nd year living on this planet. 



I used to be this very shy, introverted guy who's really passionate about visual effects, and that was what I was doing most of my time. Last year, my passion for film VFX dimmed a little, and that bought me some time for other things in life. I became obsessed with meeting people, chatting away and walking in London streets like there's nothing else mattered.



What I did find is after a long time of staying outside almost every day, staying in could be hard to do, which in turn makes doing things that require deep and sustained attention nearly impossible. It always seems like if you're not outside you're missing life, and right now it's London in summer, probably the best time of year you actually can get some sunlight. 



I've been fighting the urge to go outside every day, and luckily I started my second round of building my website, which is what you're visiting right now. After two weeks of intense focus now the website is 90% ready to use.



## Trading



Two years ago I decided to become a trader, after months and months of market tuition (the phrase you use to describe a long term losing streak with a positive attitude) I finally see some signs of the turning point. 



If you're curious, I mainly focus on day trading of small-cap stocks. No options, cryptos, or forex.



## Leaving ILM



Last year, just after my 31st birthday, I moved from film visual effects to game industry, this was a change I didn't really foresee coming. 



A new documentary series about ILM was released on Disney+ couple of days ago, being a fan of ILM and its team I got quite excited about it. I haven't watched the whole show yet, but here are some of the bits that ILM shared on the internet that really hit me.



> ILM was the place. A “Let's do something no one has ever seen before” attitude.<br>-Robert Zemeckis


And another quote from a former president of the company:

> Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be.<br>-Lynwen Brennan


These were the reasons I was attracted to the studio and the industry, in some way, I was a bit like that to begin with. The idea of dropping out of high school and pursuing my dream, was kind of what I considered not a bold move, but the only sensible one. Not everyone has to walk the same way.



When the idea of leaving ILM came to mind I hesitated, to me leaving ILM isn't about leaving the company, but whether I could carry on “creating the impossible” on my own, without surrounding myself with the people that inspire me so much. 



I paused a business idea because I thought it was impossible to execute, but recently I dug it up and started refining it. Then it dawned on me, leaving the comfort zone with the brilliant and talented people at ILM doesn't take the spirit away from me. 



## Life



Jasper sent me a post from someone on Instagram yesterday, it says:



> I love laughing with you, I love working with you, I love walking with you, I love talking with you, and I also love just existing with you, me being me and you being you.


We've been together for 4 years now, every day of our life feels like a river, quiet, nurturing and everlasting. He is everything I am not, and through the time trickling between and around us, from him, I learned kindness, sympathy, and contentment. We own two indoor cats, one black long hair girl called “Lilith” and one ginger boy “Lucifer” (Lucy for short). Jasper being the proud father is very protective of these two children.



I am on the autistic spectrum, and occasionally suffer from hyperfocus, loud noises and generally other human beings, but his presence has made my life a lot less problematic.



Early this year I was very depressed thanks to UK's award-winning weather in winter, luckily the restrictions were lifted, and I jumped on the plane to Tenerife island. Two weeks of sunshine on the beach was all I needed to survive the winter.



## Before 33



Hopefully China is going to open up this year, I would love to go back to see my friends and family, and most important of all, all the food I have been missing.



I would also push the business idea to see if it'll go anywhere. 



Reading is what I strongly advocate for anyone, recently I haven't been reading much, but I would love to get back in the habit of reading more (this time maybe more fictions than non-fictions).



Perhaps asking the world to be a better (not so crazy) place this year is a bit outstretched, so I wish everyone around me, my friends and family, good health and best of luck. People in London, hit me up and let's grab a beer or coffee!



Thanks for reading this far. ❤
