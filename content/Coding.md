## Languages I use



[[Python]] is definitely the powerhouse I use most often, it is widely adopted in the visual effects industry, mainly due to the fact that it's very easy to use and forces users to write clean and beautiful codes, sufficiently efficient for most jobs, and amazing range of libraries for all kinds of tasks.



For my own website, I used [[Typescript]], a layer built on top of [[Javascript]]. Together with [[React]], [[Next.js]] and [[TailwindCSS]] for styling. The blog section is built with a modified version of [[Quartz]] library, which is [[Obsidian]] inspired model for note-taking and writing.



I have also written some high performance tools using [[C++]] for some visual effects tasks I needed to do in the past, but nowadays since I work primarily in [[Houdini]] there's really no need for [[C++]], the built-in language [[VEX]] is a high performance language similar to C.



[[Unreal Engine]] is equipped with a node based graphic programming module called [[Blueprints System]], it's just as efficient as its [[C++]] counterpart.



## Version Control



For version control, I use [[Git]] together with [[Github]], such a godsend for everyone who wants to record versions.
