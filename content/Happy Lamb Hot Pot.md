## 📝 Notes



Their meat quality is definitely one of the best in London, and straight out of the base everything tastes excellent.

However I would still get a mixture of seseme paste and garlic in seseme oil and some red chilis for dips.



#### About The Heat

For my 32nd birthday we went there with a large group of friends, on the hottest day in summer, however the air con is super weak in the central area where they hold large groups, on top of that, with 2 boiling hot pots running the temperature was almost unbearable. 



## 🎖 Recommended 



- Sour and spicy soup base: Instead of traditional spicy red soup, get this one.

- Skewers: Their skewers are quite nice.

- Hotpot noodles: I normally have this amazingly handmade noodles to finish off the meal.

- Shrimp paste.
