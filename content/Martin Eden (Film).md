## 📝 Notes





## ℹ️ About



Martin Eden struggles to rise above his destitute, proletarian circumstances through an intense and passionate pursuit of self-education, hoping to achieve a place among the literary elite.



## ✏ Review



Sometimes changes don’t happen gradually, they take sharp 180 degree turns.



Martin’s life completely changed when she met Elena, where he fell in love both what she represented and who she was.



He was drawn to the injustice everywhere in life. Before meeting Elena he only had the physical means to rectify what he considered unfair. Luckily, he was exposed to the world of books; he decided to spend the rest of his life to become a writer.



The desire to win over Elena and her family pushed him to the road of success, at the same time, also cost him almost everything in the end. 



The film is exceptionally well made, the director chose to recreate 20th century Italy with 16 mm films, what an amazing choice! The 16 mm film gave us the quality and tones needed to faithfully represent the era, as well as the sound, I am not sure how it was recorded, but the result is something that matches the picture in perfect harmony.



In a world full of razor sharp pictures shot by 4k, even 8k digital cameras, the impressionistic images come across almost as a spa for your eyes. Everything looks so natural and organic.



Apart from the carefully chosen classical music, occasionally there are some pieces of electronic music being used in the film. However, even those are not created digitally, they sound more like they’re created with proper analogue synthesizers from the 60s.



With top-notch performance delivered by [[@Luca Marinelli]], lush and vintage cinematography shot in 16 mm film, and the occasional poetic documentary footage revealing Martin’s inner thoughts. I highly recommend this film if you want to take a break from the 8k high definition craze.
