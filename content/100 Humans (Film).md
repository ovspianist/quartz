## 📝 Notes





## ℹ️ About



A social experiment where 100 individuals will be a part of interactive experiments exploring sex, happiness, torture and all the other aspects of being human.



## ✏ Review



Recommended, the hosts devised some of the most interesting experiments, although not every one of them are actually well-designed to be accurate, they did reveal a lot of important features of us. 



Those 100 strangers would've never come together and spent their days together like this, but over the course of those experiments, most of them learned many things they didn't know about themselves. 



The episode about biases is amazing.
