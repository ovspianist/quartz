## 📝 Notes







## ℹ️ About



From the Axolotl to the Zebrafish, our planet contains a host of barely imagined beings: real creatures that are often more astonishing that anything dreamt of in the pages of a medieval bestiary. Ranging from the depths of the ocean to the most arid corners of the land, Caspar Henderson captures the beauty and bizarreness of the many living forms we thought we knew and some we could never have contemplated, inviting us to better imagine the precarious world we inhabit.
