Houdini is pretty much the only software I use for creating visual effects right now, the node based system has all the advantage over traditional 3D apps like [[Maya]], [[Max]] or [[Cinema 4D]], except for organic modelling or character animation where viewport manipulation is your main interaction with the CG assets.
