# Becoming the 3% - Unpacking the One Metric





## **The One Metric - P/L**



When you’re still learning to trade and yet to be profitable, finding out a way to check if you’re on the right track is super important to your future trading success.



On the surface, all trading performances could be judged by one metric, and that is whether you’re profitable during a period of time or not. A positive P/L means you’re good at trading, a negative one means you’re a bad trader.



It might look binary if you just focus on the P/L, but the reality is, to be a consistently profitable trader, one has to do a lot of things right to have an edge in the market. This is one of those cases that can be explained with the classic wooden barrel theory, if you have even one shortcoming, it might be the one that destroys you and prevents you from being successful at trading.



## **Rocket Building**



Have you ever watched a rocket launch event? There are only two major outcomes, successful or failed. But when the launch process itself fails, no one would ever doubt the work being put behind the scenes. Even if you don’t know anything about building a rocket, it won’t be hard to understand that, the process of a rocket launch is merely executing a plan that’s been carefully designed beforehand.



Trading should follow the same logic, when you’re executing a trade, it would be simply following a trading plan that’s been prepared in advance. Your ability to form such plans would be equivalent to the work that goes into building the rocket itself and launch procedures, without the essential work on the individual components that make up the rocket or the trader, the final product won’t be able to withstand the ever changing market.



## **Areas of focus**



So how do we evaluate progress before you are consistently profitable?



Instead of looking at the final P/L of every day, every week, every month, we should focus on different components required to trade properly.



When we start to break down the areas where an aspiring trader needs to improve, suddenly that one binary metric expands to an array of quantitative(relatively) attributes and goals to measure against.



It is a well-known fact that there are 3 cornerstones in any profitable trading:



-   Strategy

-   Risk management

-   Psychology



Each category contains many aspects a trader needs to work on before they can achieve long term success.



I will break down each one of them in the future posts.
