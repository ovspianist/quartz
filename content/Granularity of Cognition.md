Language starts with words, then phrases, then sentence structure then complex structure, then connection between sentences, the paragraphs, then structure of a whole piece.

When we’re not fluent enough, there’s a performance drop due to decoding small elements all the way towards bigger ones. 

Fluent users can grasp the meaning of a sentence through a cursory glance, new users struggle to find recognisable patterns. 

**Recognising patterns of higher levels is a key feature of fluency.** 

Output is also true, a fluent user can quickly bring up correct bigger structure and find small elements that go with it on the fly, while new users often start with small elements and find appropriate bigger structures.

As we learn a new language or other knowledge, we should aim to internalise as many higher level units as possible for faster recognition.
