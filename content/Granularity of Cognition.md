Language starts with words, then phrases, then sentence structure then complex structure, then connection between sentences, the paragraphs, then structure of a whole piece.



When we’re not fluent enough, there’s a performance drop due to decoding small elements all the way towards bigger ones. 



Fluent users can grasp the meaning of a sentence through a cursory glance, new users struggle to find recognizable patterns. 



**Recognizing patterns of higher levels is a key feature of fluency.** 



Output is also true, a fluent user can quickly bring up a correct bigger structure and find small elements that go with it on the fly, while new users often start with small elements and find appropriate bigger structures.



As we learn a new language or other knowledge, we should aim to internalize as many higher level units as possible for faster recognition.
