## Icelandic



Olafur has been one of my favourite neoclassical artists for a couple of years now, ever since I accidentally heard “Erla's Waltz”, from his early album “Found Songs”.



Recently I start slowly leaning towards Nils Frahm for music I listen to during my work time, however every time Olafur's music comes up it still brings me the sense of deep connections with the rest of the world.



I always think Icelandic artists all have the innate ability to resonate with nature and what could be called God coming from an atheist. Their music speaks to the deepest part of the listeners, in a language that can't be translated, but only be felt.



Some people might say his music is a bit too simple, true while it may be, but judging art by simplicity is subjective to philosophical debates to begin with. To the listeners, whether the artist chose to adopt a device of simple harmony or complex arrangements of multiple sonic parts is completely personal and contextual. The power of which also isn't determined by how complicated it is. 



Certain simple expressions also cut deepest.





## Some Kind of Peace



With that being said, this concert was loosely based on his recent album “some kind of peace” which I am not a big fan of.



But after so many times of postponing the show due to the pandemic, he finally started going on tours again, my friend Spike and I took the chance and booked the tickets. The tour only stops in London for two days, we went on the first day.



The concert started with “Loom”, which happened to be my favourite song from this album.



Loom is where he collaborated with [[@Bonobo]], another electronic artist I quite like. Here the piano notes act as decorations, sprinkled on top of the bass section, with a faint and distant minimalistic vocal part swimming in between, threading through all this. 





## Glitches



Halfway into the show, signal glitches started trickling in, they weren't too imposing but enough to be noticed, especially considering all the songs were quiet and slow paced. 



It went on for about 10 to 20 minutes, on and off, I thought Olafur would stop the show to fix the issue, but he just went on, ignoring the glitches which eventually faded away on its own.



The family sitting in front of us, all the children behave like responsible adults, however the mother just couldn't help herself typing away on her phone, the dad tried to stop her many times, but she insisted there are things more important on the phone and needed to be dealt with immediately. 



Another woman sitting next to them, completely unrelated to them, for every few minutes she tried to take a photo of the show, and for some reason she cannot turn off the bloody flashlight and every time she was surprised by the sudden beam of light shooting out of her phone. No matter how many times she annoyed people around her, she kept trying.





## Quiet Olafur



Olafur didn't talk a lot, I remember watching his show online where he became very chatty between songs, not on this show, well at least not until after he appeared for encore.



He then told a story about the last song he was going to play. I'll try to paraphrase the story, as it was a particularly heart-warming one.



Olafur's grandma would often ask him to go visit her because her radio was broken, but he knew, every time, the radio wasn't broken at all. But he went there, unexpectedly, to find out his grandma had prepared cookies and cakes for him, and would ask him to listen to Chopin with her, and that's what he did every time. 



Before becoming the Olafur we know today, he was a drummer in a band called "Fighting Shit”, of course his grandma wasn't a fan. After he quit the old funk band and started writing neoclassical music, he said, his grandma became the biggest fan. She would buy his albums in bulk and would just go out to meet her friends and sell them. Aren't all grandmas like her?



For her last moments, Olafur sat next to her bed in the hospital and listened to Chopin, before she eventually passed away. After he got home, he composed this piece dedicated to his grandma who, in his words, was the only reason why he started writing this kind of music. For without those hours spent with his grandma listening to Chopin, he would probably still be fighting shit. 



Then he turned back to his upright piano on the stage, quietly and lovingly, played this last song of the night, Lag Fyrir Ommu.
