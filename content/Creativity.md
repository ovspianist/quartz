## Photography

You can find on my main website for [a selection of photographs](https://cniu.art/photography).

I have a mixture of analogue and digital [[My Camera Collection|cameras]] , personally I don't really care about resolution, for me the most appealing thing about photography is the textures, both from the medium and from the subject matters.

## Art

My art creation is a bit sporadic, every year there's a time when I really want to [draw and paint something](https://cniu.art/art), which lasts about a few weeks. But I hope to have a longer lasting art making period because I really do enjoy it.
