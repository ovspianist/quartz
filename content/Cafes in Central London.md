I love working and reading in a cafe, people chatting in the background makes me easy to focus on the tasks at hand.

Here are some of the cafés I think are good for this kind of things.



## Foyles Charing Cross



Café is on 5th floor.



Air con is turned on when it's hot outside. Food is okay, scones and lemon cakes are nice.



Closes 1 hour before bookshop closes.

## Waterstones Piccadilly Circus



On the ground floor and top floor there are two cafés, there are also some seats available in the bookshop browsing area.
