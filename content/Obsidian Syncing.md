## Current solution



I'm using [[Github]] to store my whole vault. 



- $ On PC side I'm using [[Obsidian Git (Plugin)]] to automatically or manually run git command for me.

- $ On iPhone side I'm using [[Working Copy]] together with [[iOS Shortcut]] for running git and syncing vault folders.



So far this solution is very solid and does provide extra safety due to the extra history generated by [[Git]]. The only thing is you will have to manually send pull and push requests, but I prefer it this way than everything being automatically handled, which would create way too many commits.



## Other methods



- ! [[iCloud]] is being discarded because of the problem where it creates a new file every time Obsidian is trying to modify a file, thus losing the links between files. 

- & OneDrive is actually a good way of syncing non-iOS devices, but on iOS it cannot access the vault folder Obsidian uses.
