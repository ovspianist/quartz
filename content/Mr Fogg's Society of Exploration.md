## ℹ️ About



Founded by Phileas J. Fogg, Esq., The Society is located only a stone’s throw away from Charing Cross station – the starting point of his famous voyage around the world! Society fellows and adventurers alike can sip on exploratory tipples in the dimly-lit Drawing Room; let off steam with a libation or two inside our life-size Victorian Train Carriage; or gaze with wonder upon cabinets of curiosities in the mysterious Map Room.
