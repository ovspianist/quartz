It seems like the action of writing down your thoughts about the trades every day, really burns the idea in your head.</p><p>When I am in the middle of active trading I sometimes get very emotional, writing it down either right after I have the feeling or after I finish trading, helps me recognise and address those problems.</p><p>I still make mistakes I would like to stop making, but keeping a journal at least helps me visualise my progress and forces me to be honest with myself, it could be enhanced by sharing them to other traders too.</p><p>Just in case you’re curious, I use Tradervue to record all my trades and every day I write down a detailed journal of what I trade, how I trade. You don’t really need a dedicated journal software to do this, any notebook app or even pen and paper would do.</p><p><strong>There are 4 things I keep track of mainly:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>market condition</strong>, I write this before I take any trade if possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>mental state</strong>, am I too eager? Distracted? Fearful? Agitated? Calm?</p></li><li><p><strong>performance</strong>, here is detailed walk through of the whole trading day.</p></li><li><p><strong>to improve</strong>, after finishing the trading day, I write down all the things I could’ve done better today and remind myself next day.</p></li></ul><p>However you might decide to track and reflect different areas based on your trading style, instrument and time frame.</p><p>One trader I look up to a lot once said, almost all of the best traders keep detailed record of their trades, some also plan ahead before they trade on paper. If you ask them about their accuracy, profit loss ratio, risk parameters, they will know all the metrics by heart.</p><blockquote><p>“I find it hard to take a developing trader seriously who isn’t keeping a detailed daily trading journal.”</p><p>Mike Bellafiore, SMB Capital</p></blockquote><p>To solve a problem you must first acknowledge the problem, I recommend that you start your trading journals if you haven’t already, better late than never.</p><a href=#avoiding-fomo><h2 id=avoiding-fomo><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Avoiding FOMO</strong></h2></a><p>Almost everyone is having constant battle with it, the fear of missing out.</p><p>The problem that comes with FOMO is destructive, when a price move went without you and you start to chase, you’ll most likely to enter a trade, either long or short, on the extension, a place where it’s most likely to follow up with a pullback. If this move is then proven lack of conviction, it might not even be a pullback anymore. Worst case scenario that’s the furthest spot it could go, before shooting in the opposite direction with high momentum.</p><p>Even if it is a pullback, you might decide to wait for it to come back to your entry price. It could happen, but it could just as well keep going in the other direction.</p><p>You’ll be trapped in the trade and forced to liquidate the position with a big loss.</p><p>The moment we feel FOMO kicking in, more often than not, is precisely the end of the momentum. The more impressive the move is, the more your FOMO would be, the more likely a reversal is due.</p><a href=#be-selective><h2 id=be-selective><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Be selective</strong></h2></a><p>A good trader learns and accepts the fact that there are cycles in the market, the bull, the bear and the consolidation, not every type of market is suitable to trade with your strategy.</p><p>Not trading in a market that’s less favourable for your strategy could be very hard, but most traders will agree that sitting through those period in cash, is often the best move.</p><p>Being selective also means choosing between a bunch of different stocks or currencies, sometimes we are so fixated on the technical patterns we detected on the chart, that we become blind to other factors that define a good trade, be it wrong time of day, lack of volume or historical false attempts.</p><p>Failing to perform a full check on the stock and trade idea is at best a waste of time, if you get good result out of a bad trade, you’ll be encouraged to break the rules again, sooner or later your accuracy will suffer and likely generate big losses. Worst of all, you might lose confidence and when there are finally good opportunities you have become too afraid to act on them.</p><p>Trade the best and leave the rest.</p><a href=#revenge-trading><h2 id=revenge-trading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Revenge trading</strong></h2></a><p>A few scenarios will trigger a trader to act recklessly:</p><ul><li><p>missing a trade that moves in your favour but you’re too late to get in.</p></li><li><p>price hits your stop loss and then immediately reverses to your intended direction and hits your original profit target price.</p></li><li><p>losing more than half of your profit.</p></li><li><p>starting with profit then becomes losses.</p></li><li><p>one trade that wipes your profits from many trades.</p></li></ul><p>Personally if I start the day with profit and then turn negative, I would be very annoyed and likely to start revenge trading, the trajectory after that is normally a nosedive into the red abyss, digging a hole that will take me days to recover, if I’m lucky.</p><p>Learning to recognise those triggers and being able to act early to stop yourself descending deeper and deeper into the bad situation would drastically trim down your biggest red days(weeks or months depending on your trading frequency), which also means an easier time to recover.</p><a href=#dollar-amount-vs-percentage><h2 id=dollar-amount-vs-percentage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Dollar amount vs percentage</strong></h2></a><p>Whenever I can, I try to focus on my performance in percentage instead of in dollar amount.</p><p>A loss can look big but when put into perspective in relation to the account size, it might just be 3% of your equity. To me, losing 3% feels much better than losing 3000 dollars, when you have a 100,000 account.</p><p>Most people, even us traders, will equate dollars to stuff they can and want to buy, so 3000 dollars could be the beautiful camera or the trip to Iceland you have always wanted, and you just threw it away.</p><p>However a 3% drawdown is considered very acceptable to most traders.</p><p>While your account is constantly growing, the dollar amount is also changing, seeing the progress in percentage helps you normalise performance, if you can score a 3% profit every day, after 6 months of trading it’ll be 34 times of your starting point.</p><p>Technically a 3K dollars profit with a 100K account and a 30 dollars profit with a 1000 account, is exactly the same in terms of performance, the implication is that if you can do well with 3% with a small account, while 30 dollars may look insignificant, you prove you are equipped with the good knowledge and techniques to do well with a larger account.</p><p>Keeping track of this percentage you’ll also have a clear idea when and where you’re deviating from the baseline performance, are you getting sloppy and over confident, or not being able to strictly following your own rules? They are all going to reflect on the history of percentage.</p><a href=#quality-of-trades><h2 id=quality-of-trades><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Quality of trades</strong></h2></a><p>Here’s another problem, even percentage could be misleading sometimes, especially in a choppy market, you need to be extra careful of what to trade and what to leave alone. The market doesn’t care about your P/L or trading setups, so even percentage of gain is really out of your control, what you can control though, is the quality of the trade.</p><p>If you’re using a discretionary strategy in which you organically come up with stop loss and take profit levels as the trade unfolds, you should base your reaction on the technicals of the trade itself, not how much money you want to take out of the market.</p><p>If price is clearly heading towards a strong resistance level, it would be wrong to hope it’ll break through. You should either not enter the trade, or enter the trade but exit before reaching the danger zone.</p><p>Again, the market doesn’t know or care if you hit your 3% daily goal or not, it does what it wants.</p><a href=#commissions><h2 id=commissions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Commissions</strong></h2></a><p>If you’re an active day trader using a small account, some brokers charge you commissions that’s just not proportional to the account size. If you can only make 10 dollars with appropriate position size, and the commissions for a buy and a sell cost you 5 dollars, you are not going to make money. You’ll only have half of profit left, at the same time all your losses are much bigger after commissions.</p><p>Unless you have amazing accuracy and risk control, even profits sometimes end up losses because the high commissions weigh down the whole level. As a beginner trader, having a consistent break-even performance is already a challenge.</p><p>So how do you deal with this mentally?</p><p>I have been struggling with this as well. The best thing to do is to ignore the commissions, don’t even think about the net P/L after commissions. What you should be focusing on is practising discipline and consistency, not the amount of money you make. The amount of drawdown incurred by the commissions will automatically ease off when you start trading larger sizes.</p><p>What you definitely don’t want to do, is to change the way you trade to combat the impact. You need to practise the strategy as if you are trading normal size, distorting the rules to accommodate a small account will give you distorted results. Having a habit built on distorted rules is very dangerous when you switch to a big account.</p><p>Although, there is one valid optimisation you can adopt, which is to limit the quantity of trades so you don’t waste commissions. Not only that, it also has the benefit of forcing you to only trade the best setups and be extremely selective, since you don’t want to waste your only trade on opportunities less than ideal.</p><a href=#transition-to-live-account-from-paper-account><h2 id=transition-to-live-account-from-paper-account><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Transition to live account from paper account</strong></h2></a><p>Mark Douglas said something that made me look at paper trading from a completely different angle, I’ll paraphrase what he said because I can’t find the original quote.</p><p>“Paper trading result is the performance you could have if you operate without fear, greed and other psychological blocks.”</p><p>I sometimes wish someone secretly swaps my paper account with live account, I think I would’ve have much better result by thinking I am trading a simulator than live.</p><p>Almost everyone experience this dip in performance when switching to live account from paper, suddenly all those numbers in unrealised P/L start to have huge impact in psychology, decision making can be seriously damaged if greed and fear come in.</p><p>One popular advice is to start small, granted that trading is a risky business and losing is inevitable, but a small account will reduce the likelihood of losing emotional control.</p><p>Make sure all the potential losses are not something you can’t make back in one or two days, if you put one month’s salary worth of money to the account, losing 3-5% per day will probably be all right since it’s money you can make back in a few days. At least to me personally, that’s the level I am comfortable with emotionally.</p><p>If you are day trading like me, with a broker that charges commissions on each trade, then the account can’t be too small either, as I said before, the sizes should be high enough so that commissions won’t completely eliminate potential profits.</p><p>Once you’re trading live, don’t go back to simulation if you can still afford it. Going back and forth between live and simulation is generally not a good idea since you might perform better again in the simulator and then come back to live, experience the fear and lose again. Quite a lot of people get stuck in this vicious circle.</p><p>Simulation should be stopped once you have mastered the technical side of trading such as putting orders, exiting positions, managing stop loss and take profit, etc. After you are able to identify and execute trading setups, you shouldn’t really go back to simulation as long as you can afford staying in live account.</p><p>If your psychology is the reason why you have bad trading results, then going back to simulation isn’t going to provide any real solutions, since simulation can’t really simulate emotions you’d have in live trading, the best it can provide is reaffirming your strategy works, which is already proven in the strategy development and validation period anyway.</p><p>The only way forward is to face your fear and greed directly, accept loss and defeat objectively, work on it patiently, day after day, little by little, focus on gradual improvements which eventually turn to consistent profitability.</p><p>I have just lost 20% of my account yesterday, it was painful, and it wasn’t anyone’s fault but mine. Monetary loss is not fun, but what I care about most is how much I follow and respect my own rules, because that is the only thing I can control.</p><a href=#putting-it-together><h2 id=putting-it-together><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Putting it together</strong></h2></a><p>A common false belief, although I wish it to be true, is that there’s an Ah Ha moment, an epiphany, or a click, that sends a struggling trader directly to the heaven of profitability.
